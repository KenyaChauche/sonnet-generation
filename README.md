#### A Shakespeare Twitter Bot

### Project Briefing
This project creates a Twitter bot that will generate Shakespearean sonnets. The language generation model will be trained on all published sonnets that are credited to Shakespeare directly. A stretch goal of this project is to create a classification model that will run through the generated and authentic sonnets and seek to differentiate between the two. This model will likely feature some clustering as part of feature preparation.

Extra stretch goal: have some human generated data on differentiating between generated and authentic sonnets.
