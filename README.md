### Natural Language Generation with Shakespearean Sonnets

## The Problem
Natural Language Generation is an emerging and largely mysterious field. The boundaries of how NLG can perform with highly structured language have only been poked, not pushed. This project aims to test the capabilities of NLG to successfully generate compositions that fit the format of Shakespearean sonnets without additional controls.

## Background
### Sonnet Structure
Shakespearean sonnets have a very particular structure; everything has a rule by which to abide, down to the syllable. Each sonnet is composed of three quatrains and finished by one couplet at the end. A quatrain is a stanza of four lines, often focusing on one particular idea and having an alternating rhyme scheme. A couplet is a stanza with only two lines. These add up to a sonnet with 14 total lines.

This means that each quatrain will have an alternating rhyme scheme within itself, and that the rhyme structure does not extend between sonnet elements. Though there may be lines that rhyme with each other in different quatrains, this is inadvertent.

Going further into the structure, each sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, which dictates how the words of each line are to be composed. An iamb is a specific metric, where one unstressed syllable is followed by a stressed syllable, very similar to the *ba-BOOM* of a heartbeat. Each line is made up of five iambs, making each line have exactly 10 syllables. Sometimes Shakespeare gets clever and slurs syllables together or skips over them to make it fit this format (ie, using *'gainst* instead of *against*).
