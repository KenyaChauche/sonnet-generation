Sonnet I,0,"FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,"
Sonnet I,1,"That thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
Sonnet I,2,"But as the riper should by time decease,"
Sonnet I,3,His tender heir might bear his memory:
Sonnet I,4,"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
Sonnet I,5,"Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,"
Sonnet I,6,"Making a famine where abundance lies,"
Sonnet I,7,"Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel."
Sonnet I,8,Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
Sonnet I,9,"And only herald to the gaudy spring,"
Sonnet I,10,Within thine own bud buriest thy content
Sonnet I,11,"And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding."
Sonnet I,12,"  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
Sonnet I,13,"  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
Sonnet II,0,"When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,"
Sonnet II,1,"And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
Sonnet II,2,"Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,"
Sonnet II,3,"Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:"
Sonnet II,4,"Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,"
Sonnet II,5,"Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"
Sonnet II,6,"To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,"
Sonnet II,7,Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
Sonnet II,8,"How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,"
Sonnet II,9,If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Sonnet II,10,"Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'"
Sonnet II,11,Proving his beauty by succession thine!
Sonnet II,12,"  This were to be new made when thou art old,"
Sonnet II,13,  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Sonnet III,0,"Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest"
Sonnet III,1,Now is the time that face should form another;
Sonnet III,2,"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
Sonnet III,3,"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
Sonnet III,4,For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Sonnet III,5,Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Sonnet III,6,Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Sonnet III,7,"Of his self-love, to stop posterity?"
Sonnet III,8,"Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee"
Sonnet III,9,Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
Sonnet III,10,So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Sonnet III,11,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
Sonnet III,12,"  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,"
Sonnet III,13,"  Die single, and thine image dies with thee."
Sonnet IV,0,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
Sonnet IV,1,Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Sonnet IV,2,"Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,"
Sonnet IV,3,And being frank she lends to those are free.
Sonnet IV,4,"Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
Sonnet IV,5,The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Sonnet IV,6,"Profitless usurer, why dost thou use"
Sonnet IV,7,"So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
Sonnet IV,8,"For having traffic with thyself alone,"
Sonnet IV,9,Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Sonnet IV,10,"Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,"
Sonnet IV,11,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Sonnet IV,12,"  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,"
Sonnet IV,13,"  Which, used, lives th' executor to be."
Sonnet V,0,"Those hours, that with gentle work did frame"
Sonnet V,1,"The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
Sonnet V,2,Will play the tyrants to the very same
Sonnet V,3,And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
Sonnet V,4,For never-resting time leads summer on
Sonnet V,5,To hideous winter and confounds him there;
Sonnet V,6,"Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,"
Sonnet V,7,Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
Sonnet V,8,"Then, were not summer's distillation left,"
Sonnet V,9,"A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
Sonnet V,10,"Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,"
Sonnet V,11,Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
Sonnet V,12,"  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,"
Sonnet V,13,  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
Sonnet VI,0,Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
Sonnet VI,1,"In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:"
Sonnet VI,2,Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
Sonnet VI,3,"With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd."
Sonnet VI,4,"That use is not forbidden usury,"
Sonnet VI,5,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
Sonnet VI,6,"That's for thyself to breed another thee,"
Sonnet VI,7,"Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;"
Sonnet VI,8,"Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,"
Sonnet VI,9,If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
Sonnet VI,10,"Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,"
Sonnet VI,11,Leaving thee living in posterity?
Sonnet VI,12,"  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair"
Sonnet VI,13,  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Sonnet VII,0,Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
Sonnet VII,1,"Lifts up his burning head, each under eye"
Sonnet VII,2,"Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,"
Sonnet VII,3,Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
Sonnet VII,4,"And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,"
Sonnet VII,5,"Resembling strong youth in his middle age,"
Sonnet VII,6,"yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,"
Sonnet VII,7,Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
Sonnet VII,8,"But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,"
Sonnet VII,9,"Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,"
Sonnet VII,10,"The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are"
Sonnet VII,11,From his low tract and look another way:
Sonnet VII,12,"  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,"
Sonnet VII,13,"  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son."
Sonnet VIII,0,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?"
Sonnet VIII,1,"Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy."
Sonnet VIII,2,"Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,"
Sonnet VIII,3,Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
Sonnet VIII,4,"If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,"
Sonnet VIII,5,"By unions married, do offend thine ear,"
Sonnet VIII,6,"They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds"
Sonnet VIII,7,In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Sonnet VIII,8,"Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,"
Sonnet VIII,9,"Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,"
Sonnet VIII,10,Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Sonnet VIII,11,"Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:"
Sonnet VIII,12,"  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,"
Sonnet VIII,13,  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
Sonnet IX,0,Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
Sonnet IX,1,That thou consumest thyself in single life?
Sonnet IX,2,Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
Sonnet IX,3,"The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;"
Sonnet IX,4,The world will be thy widow and still weep
Sonnet IX,5,"That thou no form of thee hast left behind,"
Sonnet IX,6,When every private widow well may keep
Sonnet IX,7,By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
Sonnet IX,8,"Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend"
Sonnet IX,9,"Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;"
Sonnet IX,10,"But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,"
Sonnet IX,11,"And kept unused, the user so destroys it."
Sonnet IX,12,  No love toward others in that bosom sits
Sonnet IX,13,  That on himself such murderous shame commits.
Sonnet X,0,"For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,"
Sonnet X,1,Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Sonnet X,2,"Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,"
Sonnet X,3,But that thou none lovest is most evident;
Sonnet X,4,For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
Sonnet X,5,That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
Sonnet X,6,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Sonnet X,7,Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Sonnet X,8,"O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!"
Sonnet X,9,Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Sonnet X,10,"Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,"
Sonnet X,11,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Sonnet X,12,"  Make thee another self, for love of me,"
Sonnet X,13,  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
Sonnet XI,0,"As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest"
Sonnet XI,1,"In one of thine, from that which thou departest;"
Sonnet XI,2,And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
Sonnet XI,3,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
Sonnet XI,4,"Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:"
Sonnet XI,5,"Without this, folly, age and cold decay:"
Sonnet XI,6,"If all were minded so, the times should cease"
Sonnet XI,7,And threescore year would make the world away.
Sonnet XI,8,"Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,"
Sonnet XI,9,"Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:"
Sonnet XI,10,"Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;"
Sonnet XI,11,Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
Sonnet XI,12,"  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby"
Sonnet XI,13,"  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die."
Sonnet XII,0,"When I do count the clock that tells the time,"
Sonnet XII,1,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
Sonnet XII,2,"When I behold the violet past prime,"
Sonnet XII,3,And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
Sonnet XII,4,When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Sonnet XII,5,"Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,"
Sonnet XII,6,And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Sonnet XII,7,"Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,"
Sonnet XII,8,"Then of thy beauty do I question make,"
Sonnet XII,9,"That thou among the wastes of time must go,"
Sonnet XII,10,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
Sonnet XII,11,And die as fast as they see others grow;
Sonnet XII,12,  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
Sonnet XII,13,"  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence."
Sonnet XIII,0,"O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are"
Sonnet XIII,1,No longer yours than you yourself here live:
Sonnet XIII,2,"Against this coming end you should prepare,"
Sonnet XIII,3,And your sweet semblance to some other give.
Sonnet XIII,4,So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Sonnet XIII,5,Find no determination: then you were
Sonnet XIII,6,"Yourself again after yourself's decease,"
Sonnet XIII,7,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Sonnet XIII,8,"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,"
Sonnet XIII,9,Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Sonnet XIII,10,Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
Sonnet XIII,11,And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
Sonnet XIII,12,"  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know"
Sonnet XIII,13,  You had a father: let your son say so.
Sonnet XIV,0,Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
Sonnet XIV,1,"And yet methinks I have astronomy,"
Sonnet XIV,2,"But not to tell of good or evil luck,"
Sonnet XIV,3,"Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;"
Sonnet XIV,4,"Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,"
Sonnet XIV,5,"Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,"
Sonnet XIV,6,"Or say with princes if it shall go well,"
Sonnet XIV,7,By oft predict that I in heaven find:
Sonnet XIV,8,"But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,"
Sonnet XIV,9,"And, constant stars, in them I read such art"
Sonnet XIV,10,"As truth and beauty shall together thrive,"
Sonnet XIV,11,If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
Sonnet XIV,12,  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
Sonnet XIV,13,  Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Sonnet XV,0,When I consider every thing that grows
Sonnet XV,1,"Holds in perfection but a little moment,"
Sonnet XV,2,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Sonnet XV,3,Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
Sonnet XV,4,"When I perceive that men as plants increase,"
Sonnet XV,5,"Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,"
Sonnet XV,6,"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
Sonnet XV,7,And wear their brave state out of memory;
Sonnet XV,8,Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sonnet XV,9,"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
Sonnet XV,10,"Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,"
Sonnet XV,11,To change your day of youth to sullied night;
Sonnet XV,12,"  And all in war with Time for love of you,"
Sonnet XV,13,"  As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
Sonnet XVI,0,But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Sonnet XVI,1,"Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?"
Sonnet XVI,2,And fortify yourself in your decay
Sonnet XVI,3,With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Sonnet XVI,4,"Now stand you on the top of happy hours,"
Sonnet XVI,5,And many maiden gardens yet unset
Sonnet XVI,6,"With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,"
Sonnet XVI,7,Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
Sonnet XVI,8,"So should the lines of life that life repair,"
Sonnet XVI,9,"Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,"
Sonnet XVI,10,"Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,"
Sonnet XVI,11,Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
Sonnet XVI,12,"  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,"
Sonnet XVI,13,"  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill."
Sonnet XVII,0,"Who will believe my verse in time to come,"
Sonnet XVII,1,If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
Sonnet XVII,2,"Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb"
Sonnet XVII,3,Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
Sonnet XVII,4,If I could write the beauty of your eyes
Sonnet XVII,5,"And in fresh numbers number all your graces,"
Sonnet XVII,6,The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
Sonnet XVII,7,Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
Sonnet XVII,8,So should my papers yellow'd with their age
Sonnet XVII,9,"Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,"
Sonnet XVII,10,And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
Sonnet XVII,11,And stretched metre of an antique song:
Sonnet XVII,12,"  But were some child of yours alive that time,"
Sonnet XVII,13,  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
Sonnet XVIII,0,Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Sonnet XVIII,1,Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Sonnet XVIII,2,"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,"
Sonnet XVIII,3,And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sonnet XVIII,4,"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,"
Sonnet XVIII,5,And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
Sonnet XVIII,6,"And every fair from fair sometime declines,"
Sonnet XVIII,7,By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
Sonnet XVIII,8,But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Sonnet XVIII,9,Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Sonnet XVIII,10,"Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,"
Sonnet XVIII,11,When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
Sonnet XVIII,12,"  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,"
Sonnet XVIII,13,  So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
Sonnet XIX,0,"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,"
Sonnet XIX,1,And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Sonnet XIX,2,"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,"
Sonnet XIX,3,And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Sonnet XIX,4,"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,"
Sonnet XIX,5,"And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,"
Sonnet XIX,6,To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
Sonnet XIX,7,But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
Sonnet XIX,8,"O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,"
Sonnet XIX,9,Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Sonnet XIX,10,Him in thy course untainted do allow
Sonnet XIX,11,For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Sonnet XIX,12,"  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,"
Sonnet XIX,13,  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
Sonnet XX,0,A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
Sonnet XX,1,"Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;"
Sonnet XX,2,"A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted"
Sonnet XX,3,"With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;"
Sonnet XX,4,"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,"
Sonnet XX,5,Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
Sonnet XX,6,"A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,"
Sonnet XX,7,Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
Sonnet XX,8,And for a woman wert thou first created;
Sonnet XX,9,"Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,"
Sonnet XX,10,"And by addition me of thee defeated,"
Sonnet XX,11,By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
Sonnet XX,12,"  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,"
Sonnet XX,13,  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
Sonnet XXI,0,So is it not with me as with that Muse
Sonnet XXI,1,"Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,"
Sonnet XXI,2,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
Sonnet XXI,3,And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Sonnet XXI,4,"Making a couplement of proud compare,"
Sonnet XXI,5,"With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,"
Sonnet XXI,6,"With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare"
Sonnet XXI,7,That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
Sonnet XXI,8,"O' let me, true in love, but truly write,"
Sonnet XXI,9,"And then believe me, my love is as fair"
Sonnet XXI,10,"As any mother's child, though not so bright"
Sonnet XXI,11,As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
Sonnet XXI,12,  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
Sonnet XXI,13,  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
Sonnet XXII,0,"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,"
Sonnet XXII,1,So long as youth and thou are of one date;
Sonnet XXII,2,"But when in thee time's furrows I behold,"
Sonnet XXII,3,Then look I death my days should expiate.
Sonnet XXII,4,For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Sonnet XXII,5,"Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,"
Sonnet XXII,6,"Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:"
Sonnet XXII,7,How can I then be elder than thou art?
Sonnet XXII,8,"O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary"
Sonnet XXII,9,"As I, not for myself, but for thee will;"
Sonnet XXII,10,"Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary"
Sonnet XXII,11,As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
Sonnet XXII,12,  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
Sonnet XXII,13,"  Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again."
Sonnet XXIII,0,As an unperfect actor on the stage
Sonnet XXIII,1,"Who with his fear is put besides his part,"
Sonnet XXIII,2,"Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,"
Sonnet XXIII,3,Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.
Sonnet XXIII,4,"So I, for fear of trust, forget to say"
Sonnet XXIII,5,"The perfect ceremony of love's rite,"
Sonnet XXIII,6,"And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,"
Sonnet XXIII,7,O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
Sonnet XXIII,8,"O, let my books be then the eloquence"
Sonnet XXIII,9,"And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,"
Sonnet XXIII,10,Who plead for love and look for recompense
Sonnet XXIII,11,More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
Sonnet XXIII,12,"  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:"
Sonnet XXIII,13,  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
Sonnet XXIV,0,Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
Sonnet XXIV,1,Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
Sonnet XXIV,2,"My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,"
Sonnet XXIV,3,And perspective it is the painter's art.
Sonnet XXIV,4,"For through the painter must you see his skill,"
Sonnet XXIV,5,To find where your true image pictured lies;
Sonnet XXIV,6,"Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,"
Sonnet XXIV,7,That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
Sonnet XXIV,8,Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Sonnet XXIV,9,"Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me"
Sonnet XXIV,10,"Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun"
Sonnet XXIV,11,"Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;"
Sonnet XXIV,12,  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
Sonnet XXIV,13,"  They draw but what they see, know not the heart."
Sonnet XXV,0,Let those who are in favour with their stars
Sonnet XXV,1,"Of public honour and proud titles boast,"
Sonnet XXV,2,"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,"
Sonnet XXV,3,Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
Sonnet XXV,4,Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
Sonnet XXV,5,"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
Sonnet XXV,6,"And in themselves their pride lies buried,"
Sonnet XXV,7,For at a frown they in their glory die.
Sonnet XXV,8,"The painful warrior famoused for fight,"
Sonnet XXV,9,"After a thousand victories once foil'd,"
Sonnet XXV,10,"Is from the book of honour razed quite,"
Sonnet XXV,11,And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
Sonnet XXV,12,"  Then happy I, that love and am beloved"
Sonnet XXV,13,  Where I may not remove nor be removed.
Sonnet XXVI,0,"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage"
Sonnet XXVI,1,"Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,"
Sonnet XXVI,2,"To thee I send this written embassage,"
Sonnet XXVI,3,"To witness duty, not to show my wit:"
Sonnet XXVI,4,"Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine"
Sonnet XXVI,5,"May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,"
Sonnet XXVI,6,But that I hope some good conceit of thine
Sonnet XXVI,7,"In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;"
Sonnet XXVI,8,Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Sonnet XXVI,9,Points on me graciously with fair aspect
Sonnet XXVI,10,"And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,"
Sonnet XXVI,11,To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
Sonnet XXVI,12,  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
Sonnet XXVI,13,  Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
Sonnet XXVII,0,"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,"
Sonnet XXVII,1,The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
Sonnet XXVII,2,"But then begins a journey in my head,"
Sonnet XXVII,3,"To work my mind, when body's work's expired:"
Sonnet XXVII,4,"For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,"
Sonnet XXVII,5,"Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,"
Sonnet XXVII,6,"And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,"
Sonnet XXVII,7,Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Sonnet XXVII,8,Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Sonnet XXVII,9,"Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,"
Sonnet XXVII,10,"Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,"
Sonnet XXVII,11,Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
Sonnet XXVII,12,"  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,"
Sonnet XXVII,13,  For thee and for myself no quiet find.
Sonnet XXVIII,0,"How can I then return in happy plight,"
Sonnet XXVIII,1,That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?
Sonnet XXVIII,2,"When day's oppression is not eased by night,"
Sonnet XXVIII,3,"But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?"
Sonnet XXVIII,4,"And each, though enemies to either's reign,"
Sonnet XXVIII,5,Do in consent shake hands to torture me;
Sonnet XXVIII,6,"The one by toil, the other to complain"
Sonnet XXVIII,7,"How far I toil, still farther off from thee."
Sonnet XXVIII,8,"I tell the day, to please them thou art bright"
Sonnet XXVIII,9,And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
Sonnet XXVIII,10,"So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,"
Sonnet XXVIII,11,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
Sonnet XXVIII,12,But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
Sonnet XXVIII,13,  And night doth nightly make grief's strength
Sonnet XXVIII,14,  	seem stronger.
Sonnet XXIX,0,"When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,"
Sonnet XXIX,1,I all alone beweep my outcast state
Sonnet XXIX,2,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
Sonnet XXIX,3,"And look upon myself and curse my fate,"
Sonnet XXIX,4,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
Sonnet XXIX,5,"Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,"
Sonnet XXIX,6,"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,"
Sonnet XXIX,7,With what I most enjoy contented least;
Sonnet XXIX,8,"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,"
Sonnet XXIX,9,"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,"
Sonnet XXIX,10,Like to the lark at break of day arising
Sonnet XXIX,11,"From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;"
Sonnet XXIX,12,  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
Sonnet XXIX,13,  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
Sonnet XXX,0,When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
Sonnet XXX,1,"I summon up remembrance of things past,"
Sonnet XXX,2,"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,"
Sonnet XXX,3,And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Sonnet XXX,4,"Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,"
Sonnet XXX,5,"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,"
Sonnet XXX,6,"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,"
Sonnet XXX,7,And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
Sonnet XXX,8,"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,"
Sonnet XXX,9,And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
Sonnet XXX,10,"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,"
Sonnet XXX,11,Which I new pay as if not paid before.
Sonnet XXX,12,"  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,"
Sonnet XXX,13,  All losses are restored and sorrows end.
Sonnet XXXI,0,"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,"
Sonnet XXXI,1,"Which I by lacking have supposed dead,"
Sonnet XXXI,2,"And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,"
Sonnet XXXI,3,And all those friends which I thought buried.
Sonnet XXXI,4,How many a holy and obsequious tear
Sonnet XXXI,5,Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
Sonnet XXXI,6,"As interest of the dead, which now appear"
Sonnet XXXI,7,But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
Sonnet XXXI,8,"Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,"
Sonnet XXXI,9,"Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
Sonnet XXXI,10,Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
Sonnet XXXI,11,That due of many now is thine alone:
Sonnet XXXI,12,"  Their images I loved I view in thee,"
Sonnet XXXI,13,"  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me."
Sonnet XXXII,0,"If thou survive my well-contented day,"
Sonnet XXXII,1,"When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,"
Sonnet XXXII,2,And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
Sonnet XXXII,3,"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,"
Sonnet XXXII,4,"Compare them with the bettering of the time,"
Sonnet XXXII,5,"And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,"
Sonnet XXXII,6,"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,"
Sonnet XXXII,7,Exceeded by the height of happier men.
Sonnet XXXII,8,"O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:"
Sonnet XXXII,9,"'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,"
Sonnet XXXII,10,"A dearer birth than this his love had brought,"
Sonnet XXXII,11,To march in ranks of better equipage:
Sonnet XXXII,12,"  But since he died and poets better prove,"
Sonnet XXXII,13,"  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'"
Sonnet XXXIII,0,Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Sonnet XXXIII,1,"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,"
Sonnet XXXIII,2,"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,"
Sonnet XXXIII,3,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Sonnet XXXIII,4,Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
Sonnet XXXIII,5,"With ugly rack on his celestial face,"
Sonnet XXXIII,6,"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,"
Sonnet XXXIII,7,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
Sonnet XXXIII,8,Even so my sun one early morn did shine
Sonnet XXXIII,9,With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
Sonnet XXXIII,10,"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;"
Sonnet XXXIII,11,The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
Sonnet XXXIII,12,  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Sonnet XXXIII,13,  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
Sonnet XXXIV,0,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,"
Sonnet XXXIV,1,"And make me travel forth without my cloak,"
Sonnet XXXIV,2,"To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,"
Sonnet XXXIV,3,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Sonnet XXXIV,4,"'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,"
Sonnet XXXIV,5,"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,"
Sonnet XXXIV,6,For no man well of such a salve can speak
Sonnet XXXIV,7,That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Sonnet XXXIV,8,Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Sonnet XXXIV,9,"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:"
Sonnet XXXIV,10,The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
Sonnet XXXIV,11,To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
Sonnet XXXIV,12,"  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,"
Sonnet XXXIV,13,  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
Sonnet XXXV,0,No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
Sonnet XXXV,1,"Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;"
Sonnet XXXV,2,"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,"
Sonnet XXXV,3,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
Sonnet XXXV,4,"All men make faults, and even I in this,"
Sonnet XXXV,5,"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,"
Sonnet XXXV,6,"Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,"
Sonnet XXXV,7,Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
Sonnet XXXV,8,For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
Sonnet XXXV,9,Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
Sonnet XXXV,10,And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
Sonnet XXXV,11,Such civil war is in my love and hate
Sonnet XXXV,12,  That I an accessary needs must be
Sonnet XXXV,13,  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
Sonnet XXXVI,0,"Let me confess that we two must be twain,"
Sonnet XXXVI,1,Although our undivided loves are one:
Sonnet XXXVI,2,So shall those blots that do with me remain
Sonnet XXXVI,3,Without thy help by me be borne alone.
Sonnet XXXVI,4,"In our two loves there is but one respect,"
Sonnet XXXVI,5,"Though in our lives a separable spite,"
Sonnet XXXVI,6,"Which though it alter not love's sole effect,"
Sonnet XXXVI,7,Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
Sonnet XXXVI,8,"I may not evermore acknowledge thee,"
Sonnet XXXVI,9,"Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,"
Sonnet XXXVI,10,"Nor thou with public kindness honour me,"
Sonnet XXXVI,11,Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
Sonnet XXXVI,12,  But do not so; I love thee in such sort
Sonnet XXXVI,13,"  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
Sonnet XXXVII,0,As a decrepit father takes delight
Sonnet XXXVII,1,"To see his active child do deeds of youth,"
Sonnet XXXVII,2,"So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,"
Sonnet XXXVII,3,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
Sonnet XXXVII,4,"For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,"
Sonnet XXXVII,5,"Or any of these all, or all, or more,"
Sonnet XXXVII,6,"Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,"
Sonnet XXXVII,7,I make my love engrafted to this store:
Sonnet XXXVII,8,"So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,"
Sonnet XXXVII,9,Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
Sonnet XXXVII,10,That I in thy abundance am sufficed
Sonnet XXXVII,11,And by a part of all thy glory live.
Sonnet XXXVII,12,"  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:"
Sonnet XXXVII,13,  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
Sonnet XXXVIII,0,"How can my Muse want subject to invent,"
Sonnet XXXVIII,1,"While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse"
Sonnet XXXVIII,2,"Thine own sweet argument, too excellent"
Sonnet XXXVIII,3,For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
Sonnet XXXVIII,4,"O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me"
Sonnet XXXVIII,5,Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
Sonnet XXXVIII,6,"For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,"
Sonnet XXXVIII,7,When thou thyself dost give invention light?
Sonnet XXXVIII,8,"Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth"
Sonnet XXXVIII,9,Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
Sonnet XXXVIII,10,"And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth"
Sonnet XXXVIII,11,Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
Sonnet XXXVIII,12,"  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,"
Sonnet XXXVIII,13,"  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise."
Sonnet XXXIX,0,"O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,"
Sonnet XXXIX,1,When thou art all the better part of me?
Sonnet XXXIX,2,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
Sonnet XXXIX,3,And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
Sonnet XXXIX,4,"Even for this let us divided live,"
Sonnet XXXIX,5,"And our dear love lose name of single one,"
Sonnet XXXIX,6,That by this separation I may give
Sonnet XXXIX,7,That due to thee which thou deservest alone.
Sonnet XXXIX,8,"O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,"
Sonnet XXXIX,9,Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
Sonnet XXXIX,10,"To entertain the time with thoughts of love,"
Sonnet XXXIX,11,"Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,"
Sonnet XXXIX,12,"  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,"
Sonnet XXXIX,13,  By praising him here who doth hence remain!
Sonnet XL,0,"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;"
Sonnet XL,1,What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
Sonnet XL,2,"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;"
Sonnet XL,3,All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Sonnet XL,4,"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,"
Sonnet XL,5,I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
Sonnet XL,6,"But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest"
Sonnet XL,7,By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
Sonnet XL,8,"I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,"
Sonnet XL,9,Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
Sonnet XL,10,"And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief"
Sonnet XL,11,To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
Sonnet XL,12,"  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,"
Sonnet XL,13,  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
Sonnet XLI,0,"Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,"
Sonnet XLI,1,"When I am sometime absent from thy heart,"
Sonnet XLI,2,"Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,"
Sonnet XLI,3,For still temptation follows where thou art.
Sonnet XLI,4,"Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,"
Sonnet XLI,5,"Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;"
Sonnet XLI,6,"And when a woman woos, what woman's son"
Sonnet XLI,7,Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?
Sonnet XLI,8,"Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,"
Sonnet XLI,9,"And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,"
Sonnet XLI,10,Who lead thee in their riot even there
Sonnet XLI,11,"Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,"
Sonnet XLI,12,"  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,"
Sonnet XLI,13,"  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me."
Sonnet XLII,0,"That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,"
Sonnet XLII,1,And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
Sonnet XLII,2,"That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,"
Sonnet XLII,3,A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
Sonnet XLII,4,"Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:"
Sonnet XLII,5,"Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;"
Sonnet XLII,6,"And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
Sonnet XLII,7,Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
Sonnet XLII,8,"If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,"
Sonnet XLII,9,"And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;"
Sonnet XLII,10,"Both find each other, and I lose both twain,"
Sonnet XLII,11,And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
Sonnet XLII,12,  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
Sonnet XLII,13,  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
Sonnet XLIII,0,"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,"
Sonnet XLIII,1,For all the day they view things unrespected;
Sonnet XLIII,2,"But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,"
Sonnet XLIII,3,And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.
Sonnet XLIII,4,"Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,"
Sonnet XLIII,5,How would thy shadow's form form happy show
Sonnet XLIII,6,"To the clear day with thy much clearer light,"
Sonnet XLIII,7,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
Sonnet XLIII,8,"How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made"
Sonnet XLIII,9,"By looking on thee in the living day,"
Sonnet XLIII,10,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Sonnet XLIII,11,Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
Sonnet XLIII,12,"  All days are nights to see till I see thee,"
Sonnet XLIII,13,  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
Sonnet XLIV,0,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,"
Sonnet XLIV,1,Injurious distance should not stop my way;
Sonnet XLIV,2,"For then despite of space I would be brought,"
Sonnet XLIV,3,From limits far remote where thou dost stay.
Sonnet XLIV,4,No matter then although my foot did stand
Sonnet XLIV,5,Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
Sonnet XLIV,6,For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
Sonnet XLIV,7,As soon as think the place where he would be.
Sonnet XLIV,8,"But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,"
Sonnet XLIV,9,"To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,"
Sonnet XLIV,10,But that so much of earth and water wrought
Sonnet XLIV,11,"I must attend time's leisure with my moan,"
Sonnet XLIV,12,  Receiving nought by elements so slow
Sonnet XLIV,13,"  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe."
Sonnet XLV,0,"The other two, slight air and purging fire,"
Sonnet XLV,1,"Are both with thee, wherever I abide;"
Sonnet XLV,2,"The first my thought, the other my desire,"
Sonnet XLV,3,These present-absent with swift motion slide.
Sonnet XLV,4,For when these quicker elements are gone
Sonnet XLV,5,"In tender embassy of love to thee,"
Sonnet XLV,6,"My life, being made of four, with two alone"
Sonnet XLV,7,"Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;"
Sonnet XLV,8,Until life's composition be recured
Sonnet XLV,9,"By those swift messengers return'd from thee,"
Sonnet XLV,10,"Who even but now come back again, assured"
Sonnet XLV,11,"Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:"
Sonnet XLV,12,"  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,"
Sonnet XLV,13,  I send them back again and straight grow sad.
Sonnet XLVI,0,Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
Sonnet XLVI,1,How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
Sonnet XLVI,2,"Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,"
Sonnet XLVI,3,My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
Sonnet XLVI,4,My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--
Sonnet XLVI,5,A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
Sonnet XLVI,6,But the defendant doth that plea deny
Sonnet XLVI,7,And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
Sonnet XLVI,8,To 'cide this title is impanneled
Sonnet XLVI,9,"A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,"
Sonnet XLVI,10,And by their verdict is determined
Sonnet XLVI,11,The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
Sonnet XLVI,12,"  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,"
Sonnet XLVI,13,  And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.
Sonnet XLVII,0,"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,"
Sonnet XLVII,1,And each doth good turns now unto the other:
Sonnet XLVII,2,"When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,"
Sonnet XLVII,3,"Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,"
Sonnet XLVII,4,With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
Sonnet XLVII,5,And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
Sonnet XLVII,6,Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
Sonnet XLVII,7,And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
Sonnet XLVII,8,"So, either by thy picture or my love,"
Sonnet XLVII,9,Thyself away art resent still with me;
Sonnet XLVII,10,"For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,"
Sonnet XLVII,11,And I am still with them and they with thee;
Sonnet XLVII,12,"  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight"
Sonnet XLVII,13,  Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.
Sonnet XLVIII,0,"How careful was I, when I took my way,"
Sonnet XLVIII,1,"Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,"
Sonnet XLVIII,2,That to my use it might unused stay
Sonnet XLVIII,3,"From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!"
Sonnet XLVIII,4,"But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,"
Sonnet XLVIII,5,"Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,"
Sonnet XLVIII,6,"Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,"
Sonnet XLVIII,7,Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
Sonnet XLVIII,8,"Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,"
Sonnet XLVIII,9,"Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,"
Sonnet XLVIII,10,"Within the gentle closure of my breast,"
Sonnet XLVIII,11,From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
Sonnet XLVIII,12,"  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,"
Sonnet XLVIII,13,  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
Sonnet XLIX,0,"Against that time, if ever that time come,"
Sonnet XLIX,1,"When I shall see thee frown on my defects,"
Sonnet XLIX,2,"When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,"
Sonnet XLIX,3,Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
Sonnet XLIX,4,Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
Sonnet XLIX,5,"And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,"
Sonnet XLIX,6,"When love, converted from the thing it was,"
Sonnet XLIX,7,"Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--"
Sonnet XLIX,8,Against that time do I ensconce me here
Sonnet XLIX,9,"Within the knowledge of mine own desert,"
Sonnet XLIX,10,"And this my hand against myself uprear,"
Sonnet XLIX,11,To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
Sonnet XLIX,12,"  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,"
Sonnet XLIX,13,  Since why to love I can allege no cause.
Sonnet L,0,"How heavy do I journey on the way,"
Sonnet L,1,"When what I seek, my weary travel's end,"
Sonnet L,2,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
Sonnet L,3,'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
Sonnet L,4,"The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,"
Sonnet L,5,"Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,"
Sonnet L,6,As if by some instinct the wretch did know
Sonnet L,7,"His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:"
Sonnet L,8,The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
Sonnet L,9,That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
Sonnet L,10,"Which heavily he answers with a groan,"
Sonnet L,11,More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
Sonnet L,12,  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
Sonnet L,13,  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
Sonnet LI,0,Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Sonnet LI,1,Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
Sonnet LI,2,From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
Sonnet LI,3,"Till I return, of posting is no need."
Sonnet LI,4,"O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,"
Sonnet LI,5,When swift extremity can seem but slow?
Sonnet LI,6,"Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;"
Sonnet LI,7,In winged speed no motion shall I know:
Sonnet LI,8,Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Sonnet LI,9,"Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,"
Sonnet LI,10,Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
Sonnet LI,11,"But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;"
Sonnet LI,12,"  Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,"
Sonnet LI,13,"  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."
Sonnet LII,0,"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key"
Sonnet LII,1,"Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,"
Sonnet LII,2,"The which he will not every hour survey,"
Sonnet LII,3,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
Sonnet LII,4,"Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,"
Sonnet LII,5,"Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,"
Sonnet LII,6,"Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,"
Sonnet LII,7,Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
Sonnet LII,8,"So is the time that keeps you as my chest,"
Sonnet LII,9,"Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,"
Sonnet LII,10,"To make some special instant special blest,"
Sonnet LII,11,By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
Sonnet LII,12,"  Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,"
Sonnet LII,13,"  Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope."
Sonnet LIII,0,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,"
Sonnet LIII,1,That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Sonnet LIII,2,"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,"
Sonnet LIII,3,"And you, but one, can every shadow lend."
Sonnet LIII,4,"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit"
Sonnet LIII,5,Is poorly imitated after you;
Sonnet LIII,6,"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,"
Sonnet LIII,7,And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
Sonnet LIII,8,Speak of the spring and foison of the year;
Sonnet LIII,9,"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,"
Sonnet LIII,10,The other as your bounty doth appear;
Sonnet LIII,11,And you in every blessed shape we know.
Sonnet LIII,12,"  In all external grace you have some part,"
Sonnet LIII,13,"  But you like none, none you, for constant heart."
Sonnet LIV,0,"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem"
Sonnet LIV,1,By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
Sonnet LIV,2,"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem"
Sonnet LIV,3,For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
Sonnet LIV,4,The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye
Sonnet LIV,5,"As the perfumed tincture of the roses,"
Sonnet LIV,6,Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
Sonnet LIV,7,When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
Sonnet LIV,8,"But, for their virtue only is their show,"
Sonnet LIV,9,"They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,"
Sonnet LIV,10,Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Sonnet LIV,11,Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
Sonnet LIV,12,"  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,"
Sonnet LIV,13,"  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth."
Sonnet LV,0,"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments"
Sonnet LV,1,"Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;"
Sonnet LV,2,But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Sonnet LV,3,Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
Sonnet LV,4,"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,"
Sonnet LV,5,"And broils root out the work of masonry,"
Sonnet LV,6,Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
Sonnet LV,7,The living record of your memory.
Sonnet LV,8,'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Sonnet LV,9,Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Sonnet LV,10,Even in the eyes of all posterity
Sonnet LV,11,That wear this world out to the ending doom.
Sonnet LV,12,"  So, till the judgment that yourself arise,"
Sonnet LV,13,"  You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes."
Sonnet LVI,0,"Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said"
Sonnet LVI,1,"Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,"
Sonnet LVI,2,"Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,"
Sonnet LVI,3,To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:
Sonnet LVI,4,"So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill"
Sonnet LVI,5,"Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,"
Sonnet LVI,6,"To-morrow see again, and do not kill"
Sonnet LVI,7,The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
Sonnet LVI,8,Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Sonnet LVI,9,"Which parts the shore, where two contracted new"
Sonnet LVI,10,"Come daily to the banks, that, when they see"
Sonnet LVI,11,"Return of love, more blest may be the view;"
Sonnet LVI,12,"  Else call it winter, which being full of care"
Sonnet LVI,13,"  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare."
Sonnet LVII,0,"Being your slave, what should I do but tend"
Sonnet LVII,1,Upon the hours and times of your desire?
Sonnet LVII,2,"I have no precious time at all to spend,"
Sonnet LVII,3,"Nor services to do, till you require."
Sonnet LVII,4,Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Sonnet LVII,5,"Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,"
Sonnet LVII,6,Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
Sonnet LVII,7,When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Sonnet LVII,8,Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Sonnet LVII,9,"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,"
Sonnet LVII,10,"But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought"
Sonnet LVII,11,"Save, where you are how happy you make those."
Sonnet LVII,12,"  So true a fool is love that in your will,"
Sonnet LVII,13,"  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill."
Sonnet LVIII,0,"That god forbid that made me first your slave,"
Sonnet LVIII,1,"I should in thought control your times of pleasure,"
Sonnet LVIII,2,"Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,"
Sonnet LVIII,3,"Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!"
Sonnet LVIII,4,"O, let me suffer, being at your beck,"
Sonnet LVIII,5,The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
Sonnet LVIII,6,"And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,"
Sonnet LVIII,7,Without accusing you of injury.
Sonnet LVIII,8,"Be where you list, your charter is so strong"
Sonnet LVIII,9,That you yourself may privilege your time
Sonnet LVIII,10,To what you will; to you it doth belong
Sonnet LVIII,11,Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
Sonnet LVIII,12,"  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;"
Sonnet LVIII,13,"  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well."
Sonnet LIX,0,"If there be nothing new, but that which is"
Sonnet LIX,1,"Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,"
Sonnet LIX,2,"Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss"
Sonnet LIX,3,The second burden of a former child!
Sonnet LIX,4,"O, that record could with a backward look,"
Sonnet LIX,5,"Even of five hundred courses of the sun,"
Sonnet LIX,6,"Show me your image in some antique book,"
Sonnet LIX,7,Since mind at first in character was done!
Sonnet LIX,8,That I might see what the old world could say
Sonnet LIX,9,To this composed wonder of your frame;
Sonnet LIX,10,"Whether we are mended, or whether better they,"
Sonnet LIX,11,Or whether revolution be the same.
Sonnet LIX,12,"  O, sure I am, the wits of former days"
Sonnet LIX,13,  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
Sonnet LX,0,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,"
Sonnet LX,1,So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Sonnet LX,2,"Each changing place with that which goes before,"
Sonnet LX,3,In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Sonnet LX,4,"Nativity, once in the main of light,"
Sonnet LX,5,"Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,"
Sonnet LX,6,"Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,"
Sonnet LX,7,And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
Sonnet LX,8,Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
Sonnet LX,9,"And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,"
Sonnet LX,10,"Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,"
Sonnet LX,11,And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
Sonnet LX,12,"  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,"
Sonnet LX,13,"  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand."
Sonnet LXI,0,Is it thy will thy image should keep open
Sonnet LXI,1,My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
Sonnet LXI,2,"Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,"
Sonnet LXI,3,While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
Sonnet LXI,4,Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
Sonnet LXI,5,"So far from home into my deeds to pry,"
Sonnet LXI,6,"To find out shames and idle hours in me,"
Sonnet LXI,7,The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
Sonnet LXI,8,"O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:"
Sonnet LXI,9,It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
Sonnet LXI,10,"Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,"
Sonnet LXI,11,To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
Sonnet LXI,12,"  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,"
Sonnet LXI,13,"  From me far off, with others all too near."
Sonnet LXII,0,Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
Sonnet LXII,1,And all my soul and all my every part;
Sonnet LXII,2,"And for this sin there is no remedy,"
Sonnet LXII,3,It is so grounded inward in my heart.
Sonnet LXII,4,"Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,"
Sonnet LXII,5,"No shape so true, no truth of such account;"
Sonnet LXII,6,"And for myself mine own worth do define,"
Sonnet LXII,7,As I all other in all worths surmount.
Sonnet LXII,8,"But when my glass shows me myself indeed,"
Sonnet LXII,9,"Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,"
Sonnet LXII,10,Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
Sonnet LXII,11,Self so self-loving were iniquity.
Sonnet LXII,12,"  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,"
Sonnet LXII,13,  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
Sonnet LXIII,0,"Against my love shall be, as I am now,"
Sonnet LXIII,1,With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
Sonnet LXIII,2,When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
Sonnet LXIII,3,With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
Sonnet LXIII,4,"Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,"
Sonnet LXIII,5,And all those beauties whereof now he's king
Sonnet LXIII,6,"Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,"
Sonnet LXIII,7,Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
Sonnet LXIII,8,For such a time do I now fortify
Sonnet LXIII,9,"Against confounding age's cruel knife,"
Sonnet LXIII,10,That he shall never cut from memory
Sonnet LXIII,11,"My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:"
Sonnet LXIII,12,"  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,"
Sonnet LXIII,13,"  And they shall live, and he in them still green."
Sonnet LXIV,0,When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
Sonnet LXIV,1,The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
Sonnet LXIV,2,When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
Sonnet LXIV,3,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
Sonnet LXIV,4,When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Sonnet LXIV,5,"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
Sonnet LXIV,6,"And the firm soil win of the watery main,"
Sonnet LXIV,7,Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
Sonnet LXIV,8,"When I have seen such interchange of state,"
Sonnet LXIV,9,Or state itself confounded to decay;
Sonnet LXIV,10,"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
Sonnet LXIV,11,That Time will come and take my love away.
Sonnet LXIV,12,"  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
Sonnet LXIV,13,  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
Sonnet LXV,0,"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,"
Sonnet LXV,1,"But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,"
Sonnet LXV,2,"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,"
Sonnet LXV,3,Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
Sonnet LXV,4,"O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out"
Sonnet LXV,5,"Against the wreckful siege of battering days,"
Sonnet LXV,6,"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,"
Sonnet LXV,7,"Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?"
Sonnet LXV,8,"O fearful meditation! where, alack,"
Sonnet LXV,9,Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
Sonnet LXV,10,Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Sonnet LXV,11,Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
Sonnet LXV,12,"  O, none, unless this miracle have might,"
Sonnet LXV,13,  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
Sonnet LXVI,0,"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,"
Sonnet LXVI,1,"As, to behold desert a beggar born,"
Sonnet LXVI,2,"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,"
Sonnet LXVI,3,"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,"
Sonnet LXVI,4,"And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,"
Sonnet LXVI,5,"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,"
Sonnet LXVI,6,"And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,"
Sonnet LXVI,7,"And strength by limping sway disabled,"
Sonnet LXVI,8,"And art made tongue-tied by authority,"
Sonnet LXVI,9,"And folly doctor-like controlling skill,"
Sonnet LXVI,10,"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,"
Sonnet LXVI,11,And captive good attending captain ill:
Sonnet LXVI,12,"  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,"
Sonnet LXVI,13,"  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone."
Sonnet LXVII,0,"Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,"
Sonnet LXVII,1,"And with his presence grace impiety,"
Sonnet LXVII,2,That sin by him advantage should achieve
Sonnet LXVII,3,And lace itself with his society?
Sonnet LXVII,4,Why should false painting imitate his cheek
Sonnet LXVII,5,And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
Sonnet LXVII,6,Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Sonnet LXVII,7,"Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?"
Sonnet LXVII,8,"Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,"
Sonnet LXVII,9,Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
Sonnet LXVII,10,"For she hath no exchequer now but his,"
Sonnet LXVII,11,"And, proud of many, lives upon his gains."
Sonnet LXVII,12,"  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had"
Sonnet LXVII,13,"  In days long since, before these last so bad."
Sonnet LXVIII,0,"Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,"
Sonnet LXVIII,1,"When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,"
Sonnet LXVIII,2,"Before the bastard signs of fair were born,"
Sonnet LXVIII,3,Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
Sonnet LXVIII,4,"Before the golden tresses of the dead,"
Sonnet LXVIII,5,"The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,"
Sonnet LXVIII,6,To live a second life on second head;
Sonnet LXVIII,7,Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
Sonnet LXVIII,8,"In him those holy antique hours are seen,"
Sonnet LXVIII,9,"Without all ornament, itself and true,"
Sonnet LXVIII,10,"Making no summer of another's green,"
Sonnet LXVIII,11,Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
Sonnet LXVIII,12,"  And him as for a map doth Nature store,"
Sonnet LXVIII,13,  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
Sonnet LXIX,0,Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
Sonnet LXIX,1,Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
Sonnet LXIX,2,"All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,"
Sonnet LXIX,3,"Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend."
Sonnet LXIX,4,Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
Sonnet LXIX,5,But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
Sonnet LXIX,6,In other accents do this praise confound
Sonnet LXIX,7,By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
Sonnet LXIX,8,"They look into the beauty of thy mind,"
Sonnet LXIX,9,"And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;"
Sonnet LXIX,10,"Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,"
Sonnet LXIX,11,To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
Sonnet LXIX,12,"  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,"
Sonnet LXIX,13,"  The solve is this, that thou dost common grow."
Sonnet LXX,0,"That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,"
Sonnet LXX,1,For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
Sonnet LXX,2,"The ornament of beauty is suspect,"
Sonnet LXX,3,A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
Sonnet LXX,4,"So thou be good, slander doth but approve"
Sonnet LXX,5,"Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;"
Sonnet LXX,6,"For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,"
Sonnet LXX,7,And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
Sonnet LXX,8,"Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,"
Sonnet LXX,9,Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
Sonnet LXX,10,"Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,"
Sonnet LXX,11,To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
Sonnet LXX,12,"  If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,"
Sonnet LXX,13,  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
Sonnet LXXI,0,No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Sonnet LXXI,1,Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Sonnet LXXI,2,Give warning to the world that I am fled
Sonnet LXXI,3,"From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:"
Sonnet LXXI,4,"Nay, if you read this line, remember not"
Sonnet LXXI,5,The hand that writ it; for I love you so
Sonnet LXXI,6,That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
Sonnet LXXI,7,If thinking on me then should make you woe.
Sonnet LXXI,8,"O, if, I say, you look upon this verse"
Sonnet LXXI,9,"When I perhaps compounded am with clay,"
Sonnet LXXI,10,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
Sonnet LXXI,11,"But let your love even with my life decay,"
Sonnet LXXI,12,  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
Sonnet LXXI,13,  And mock you with me after I am gone.
Sonnet LXXII,0,"O, lest the world should task you to recite"
Sonnet LXXII,1,"What merit lived in me, that you should love"
Sonnet LXXII,2,"After my death, dear love, forget me quite,"
Sonnet LXXII,3,For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
Sonnet LXXII,4,"Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,"
Sonnet LXXII,5,"To do more for me than mine own desert,"
Sonnet LXXII,6,And hang more praise upon deceased I
Sonnet LXXII,7,Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
Sonnet LXXII,8,"O, lest your true love may seem false in this,"
Sonnet LXXII,9,"That you for love speak well of me untrue,"
Sonnet LXXII,10,"My name be buried where my body is,"
Sonnet LXXII,11,And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
Sonnet LXXII,12,"  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,"
Sonnet LXXII,13,"  And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
Sonnet LXXIII,0,That time of year thou mayst in me behold
Sonnet LXXIII,1,"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang"
Sonnet LXXIII,2,"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"
Sonnet LXXIII,3,"Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."
Sonnet LXXIII,4,In me thou seest the twilight of such day
Sonnet LXXIII,5,"As after sunset fadeth in the west,"
Sonnet LXXIII,6,"Which by and by black night doth take away,"
Sonnet LXXIII,7,"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest."
Sonnet LXXIII,8,In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
Sonnet LXXIII,9,"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
Sonnet LXXIII,10,As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Sonnet LXXIII,11,Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
Sonnet LXXIII,12,"  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,"
Sonnet LXXIII,13,  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
Sonnet LXXIV,0,But be contented: when that fell arrest
Sonnet LXXIV,1,"Without all bail shall carry me away,"
Sonnet LXXIV,2,"My life hath in this line some interest,"
Sonnet LXXIV,3,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
Sonnet LXXIV,4,"When thou reviewest this, thou dost review"
Sonnet LXXIV,5,The very part was consecrate to thee:
Sonnet LXXIV,6,"The earth can have but earth, which is his due;"
Sonnet LXXIV,7,"My spirit is thine, the better part of me:"
Sonnet LXXIV,8,"So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,"
Sonnet LXXIV,9,"The prey of worms, my body being dead,"
Sonnet LXXIV,10,"The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,"
Sonnet LXXIV,11,Too base of thee to be remembered.
Sonnet LXXIV,12,"  The worth of that is that which it contains,"
Sonnet LXXIV,13,"  And that is this, and this with thee remains."
Sonnet LXXV,0,"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,"
Sonnet LXXV,1,Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
Sonnet LXXV,2,And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Sonnet LXXV,3,As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
Sonnet LXXV,4,Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Sonnet LXXV,5,"Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,"
Sonnet LXXV,6,"Now counting best to be with you alone,"
Sonnet LXXV,7,Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
Sonnet LXXV,8,Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
Sonnet LXXV,9,And by and by clean starved for a look;
Sonnet LXXV,10,"Possessing or pursuing no delight,"
Sonnet LXXV,11,Save what is had or must from you be took.
Sonnet LXXV,12,"  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,"
Sonnet LXXV,13,"  Or gluttoning on all, or all away."
Sonnet LXXVI,0,"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,"
Sonnet LXXVI,1,So far from variation or quick change?
Sonnet LXXVI,2,Why with the time do I not glance aside
Sonnet LXXVI,3,To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
Sonnet LXXVI,4,"Why write I still all one, ever the same,"
Sonnet LXXVI,5,"And keep invention in a noted weed,"
Sonnet LXXVI,6,"That every word doth almost tell my name,"
Sonnet LXXVI,7,Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
Sonnet LXXVI,8,"O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,"
Sonnet LXXVI,9,And you and love are still my argument;
Sonnet LXXVI,10,"So all my best is dressing old words new,"
Sonnet LXXVI,11,Spending again what is already spent:
Sonnet LXXVI,12,"  For as the sun is daily new and old,"
Sonnet LXXVI,13,  So is my love still telling what is told.
Sonnet LXXVII,0,"Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,"
Sonnet LXXVII,1,Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
Sonnet LXXVII,2,"The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,"
Sonnet LXXVII,3,And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.
Sonnet LXXVII,4,The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Sonnet LXXVII,5,Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Sonnet LXXVII,6,Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
Sonnet LXXVII,7,Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Sonnet LXXVII,8,"Look, what thy memory can not contain"
Sonnet LXXVII,9,"Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find"
Sonnet LXXVII,10,"Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,"
Sonnet LXXVII,11,To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
Sonnet LXXVII,12,"  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,"
Sonnet LXXVII,13,  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
Sonnet LXXVIII,0,So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
Sonnet LXXVIII,1,And found such fair assistance in my verse
Sonnet LXXVIII,2,As every alien pen hath got my use
Sonnet LXXVIII,3,And under thee their poesy disperse.
Sonnet LXXVIII,4,Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
Sonnet LXXVIII,5,And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Sonnet LXXVIII,6,Have added feathers to the learned's wing
Sonnet LXXVIII,7,And given grace a double majesty.
Sonnet LXXVIII,8,"Yet be most proud of that which I compile,"
Sonnet LXXVIII,9,Whose influence is thine and born of thee:
Sonnet LXXVIII,10,"In others' works thou dost but mend the style,"
Sonnet LXXVIII,11,And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
Sonnet LXXVIII,12,  But thou art all my art and dost advance
Sonnet LXXVIII,13,  As high as learning my rude ignorance.
Sonnet LXXIX,0,"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,"
Sonnet LXXIX,1,"My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,"
Sonnet LXXIX,2,But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
Sonnet LXXIX,3,And my sick Muse doth give another place.
Sonnet LXXIX,4,"I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument"
Sonnet LXXIX,5,"Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,"
Sonnet LXXIX,6,Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
Sonnet LXXIX,7,He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
Sonnet LXXIX,8,He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
Sonnet LXXIX,9,From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
Sonnet LXXIX,10,And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
Sonnet LXXIX,11,No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
Sonnet LXXIX,12,"  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,"
Sonnet LXXIX,13,  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.
Sonnet LXXX,0,"O, how I faint when I of you do write,"
Sonnet LXXX,1,"Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,"
Sonnet LXXX,2,"And in the praise thereof spends all his might,"
Sonnet LXXX,3,"To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!"
Sonnet LXXX,4,"But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,"
Sonnet LXXX,5,"The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,"
Sonnet LXXX,6,My saucy bark inferior far to his
Sonnet LXXX,7,On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
Sonnet LXXX,8,"Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,"
Sonnet LXXX,9,Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
Sonnet LXXX,10,"Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,"
Sonnet LXXX,11,He of tall building and of goodly pride:
Sonnet LXXX,12,"  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,"
Sonnet LXXX,13,  The worst was this; my love was my decay.
Sonnet LXXXI,0,"Or I shall live your epitaph to make,"
Sonnet LXXXI,1,Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
Sonnet LXXXI,2,"From hence your memory death cannot take,"
Sonnet LXXXI,3,Although in me each part will be forgotten.
Sonnet LXXXI,4,"Your name from hence immortal life shall have,"
Sonnet LXXXI,5,"Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:"
Sonnet LXXXI,6,"The earth can yield me but a common grave,"
Sonnet LXXXI,7,When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
Sonnet LXXXI,8,"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,"
Sonnet LXXXI,9,"Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,"
Sonnet LXXXI,10,And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
Sonnet LXXXI,11,When all the breathers of this world are dead;
Sonnet LXXXI,12,  You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
Sonnet LXXXI,13,"  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men."
Sonnet LXXXII,0,I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
Sonnet LXXXII,1,And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
Sonnet LXXXII,2,The dedicated words which writers use
Sonnet LXXXII,3,"Of their fair subject, blessing every book"
Sonnet LXXXII,4,"Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,"
Sonnet LXXXII,5,"Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,"
Sonnet LXXXII,6,And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Sonnet LXXXII,7,Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
Sonnet LXXXII,8,"And do so, love; yet when they have devised"
Sonnet LXXXII,9,"What strained touches rhetoric can lend,"
Sonnet LXXXII,10,Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
Sonnet LXXXII,11,In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
Sonnet LXXXII,12,  And their gross painting might be better used
Sonnet LXXXII,13,  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
Sonnet LXXXIII,0,I never saw that you did painting need
Sonnet LXXXIII,1,And therefore to your fair no painting set;
Sonnet LXXXIII,2,"I found, or thought I found, you did exceed"
Sonnet LXXXIII,3,The barren tender of a poet's debt;
Sonnet LXXXIII,4,"And therefore have I slept in your report,"
Sonnet LXXXIII,5,That you yourself being extant well might show
Sonnet LXXXIII,6,"How far a modern quill doth come too short,"
Sonnet LXXXIII,7,"Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow."
Sonnet LXXXIII,8,"This silence for my sin you did impute,"
Sonnet LXXXIII,9,"Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;"
Sonnet LXXXIII,10,"For I impair not beauty being mute,"
Sonnet LXXXIII,11,When others would give life and bring a tomb.
Sonnet LXXXIII,12,  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Sonnet LXXXIII,13,  Than both your poets can in praise devise.
Sonnet LXXXIV,0,Who is it that says most? which can say more
Sonnet LXXXIV,1,"Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?"
Sonnet LXXXIV,2,In whose confine immured is the store
Sonnet LXXXIV,3,Which should example where your equal grew.
Sonnet LXXXIV,4,Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
Sonnet LXXXIV,5,That to his subject lends not some small glory;
Sonnet LXXXIV,6,"But he that writes of you, if he can tell"
Sonnet LXXXIV,7,"That you are you, so dignifies his story,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,8,"Let him but copy what in you is writ,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,9,"Not making worse what nature made so clear,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,10,"And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,11,Making his style admired every where.
Sonnet LXXXIV,12,"  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,13,"  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse."
Sonnet LXXXV,0,"My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,"
Sonnet LXXXV,1,"While comments of your praise, richly compiled,"
Sonnet LXXXV,2,Reserve their character with golden quill
Sonnet LXXXV,3,And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
Sonnet LXXXV,4,"I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,"
Sonnet LXXXV,5,And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'
Sonnet LXXXV,6,To every hymn that able spirit affords
Sonnet LXXXV,7,In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
Sonnet LXXXV,8,"Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'"
Sonnet LXXXV,9,And to the most of praise add something more;
Sonnet LXXXV,10,"But that is in my thought, whose love to you,"
Sonnet LXXXV,11,"Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before."
Sonnet LXXXV,12,"  Then others for the breath of words respect,"
Sonnet LXXXV,13,"  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect."
Sonnet LXXXVI,0,"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,"
Sonnet LXXXVI,1,"Bound for the prize of all too precious you,"
Sonnet LXXXVI,2,"That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,"
Sonnet LXXXVI,3,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
Sonnet LXXXVI,4,"Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write"
Sonnet LXXXVI,5,"Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?"
Sonnet LXXXVI,6,"No, neither he, nor his compeers by night"
Sonnet LXXXVI,7,"Giving him aid, my verse astonished."
Sonnet LXXXVI,8,"He, nor that affable familiar ghost"
Sonnet LXXXVI,9,Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
Sonnet LXXXVI,10,As victors of my silence cannot boast;
Sonnet LXXXVI,11,I was not sick of any fear from thence:
Sonnet LXXXVI,12,"  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,"
Sonnet LXXXVI,13,  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.
Sonnet LXXXVII,0,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,"
Sonnet LXXXVII,1,And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
Sonnet LXXXVII,2,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
Sonnet LXXXVII,3,My bonds in thee are all determinate.
Sonnet LXXXVII,4,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
Sonnet LXXXVII,5,And for that riches where is my deserving?
Sonnet LXXXVII,6,"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,"
Sonnet LXXXVII,7,And so my patent back again is swerving.
Sonnet LXXXVII,8,"Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,"
Sonnet LXXXVII,9,"Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;"
Sonnet LXXXVII,10,"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,"
Sonnet LXXXVII,11,"Comes home again, on better judgment making."
Sonnet LXXXVII,12,"  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,"
Sonnet LXXXVII,13,"  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,0,"When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,1,"And place my merit in the eye of scorn,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,2,"Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,3,"And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,4,"With mine own weakness being best acquainted,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,5,Upon thy part I can set down a story
Sonnet LXXXVIII,6,"Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,7,That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
Sonnet LXXXVIII,8,And I by this will be a gainer too;
Sonnet LXXXVIII,9,"For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,10,"The injuries that to myself I do,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,11,"Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,12,"  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,13,  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.
Sonnet LXXXIX,0,"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,1,And I will comment upon that offence;
Sonnet LXXXIX,2,"Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,3,Against thy reasons making no defence.
Sonnet LXXXIX,4,"Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,5,"To set a form upon desired change,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,6,"As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,7,"I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,8,"Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue"
Sonnet LXXXIX,9,"Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,10,"Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong"
Sonnet LXXXIX,11,And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
Sonnet LXXXIX,12,"  For thee against myself I'll vow debate,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,13,  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
Sonnet XC,0,"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;"
Sonnet XC,1,"Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,"
Sonnet XC,2,"Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,"
Sonnet XC,3,And do not drop in for an after-loss:
Sonnet XC,4,"Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,"
Sonnet XC,5,Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
Sonnet XC,6,"Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,"
Sonnet XC,7,To linger out a purposed overthrow.
Sonnet XC,8,"If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,"
Sonnet XC,9,When other petty griefs have done their spite
Sonnet XC,10,But in the onset come; so shall I taste
Sonnet XC,11,"At first the very worst of fortune's might,"
Sonnet XC,12,"  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,"
Sonnet XC,13,  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
Sonnet XCI,0,"Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,"
Sonnet XCI,1,"Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,"
Sonnet XCI,2,"Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,"
Sonnet XCI,3,"Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;"
Sonnet XCI,4,"And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,"
Sonnet XCI,5,Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
Sonnet XCI,6,But these particulars are not my measure;
Sonnet XCI,7,All these I better in one general best.
Sonnet XCI,8,"Thy love is better than high birth to me,"
Sonnet XCI,9,"Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,"
Sonnet XCI,10,Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
Sonnet XCI,11,"And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:"
Sonnet XCI,12,"  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take"
Sonnet XCI,13,  All this away and me most wretched make.
Sonnet XCII,0,"But do thy worst to steal thyself away,"
Sonnet XCII,1,"For term of life thou art assured mine,"
Sonnet XCII,2,"And life no longer than thy love will stay,"
Sonnet XCII,3,For it depends upon that love of thine.
Sonnet XCII,4,"Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,"
Sonnet XCII,5,When in the least of them my life hath end.
Sonnet XCII,6,I see a better state to me belongs
Sonnet XCII,7,Than that which on thy humour doth depend;
Sonnet XCII,8,"Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,"
Sonnet XCII,9,Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
Sonnet XCII,10,"O, what a happy title do I find,"
Sonnet XCII,11,"Happy to have thy love, happy to die!"
Sonnet XCII,12,  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
Sonnet XCII,13,"  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not."
Sonnet XCIII,0,"So shall I live, supposing thou art true,"
Sonnet XCIII,1,Like a deceived husband; so love's face
Sonnet XCIII,2,"May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;"
Sonnet XCIII,3,"Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:"
Sonnet XCIII,4,"For there can live no hatred in thine eye,"
Sonnet XCIII,5,Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
Sonnet XCIII,6,In many's looks the false heart's history
Sonnet XCIII,7,"Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,"
Sonnet XCIII,8,But heaven in thy creation did decree
Sonnet XCIII,9,That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Sonnet XCIII,10,"Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,"
Sonnet XCIII,11,Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
Sonnet XCIII,12,"  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,"
Sonnet XCIII,13,  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
Sonnet XCIV,0,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,"
Sonnet XCIV,1,"That do not do the thing they most do show,"
Sonnet XCIV,2,"Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,"
Sonnet XCIV,3,"Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
Sonnet XCIV,4,They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
Sonnet XCIV,5,And husband nature's riches from expense;
Sonnet XCIV,6,"They are the lords and owners of their faces,"
Sonnet XCIV,7,Others but stewards of their excellence.
Sonnet XCIV,8,"The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,"
Sonnet XCIV,9,"Though to itself it only live and die,"
Sonnet XCIV,10,"But if that flower with base infection meet,"
Sonnet XCIV,11,The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
Sonnet XCIV,12,  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Sonnet XCIV,13,  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
Sonnet XCV,0,How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Sonnet XCV,1,"Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,"
Sonnet XCV,2,Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
Sonnet XCV,3,"O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!"
Sonnet XCV,4,"That tongue that tells the story of thy days,"
Sonnet XCV,5,"Making lascivious comments on thy sport,"
Sonnet XCV,6,Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
Sonnet XCV,7,Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
Sonnet XCV,8,"O, what a mansion have those vices got"
Sonnet XCV,9,"Which for their habitation chose out thee,"
Sonnet XCV,10,"Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,"
Sonnet XCV,11,And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!
Sonnet XCV,12,"  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;"
Sonnet XCV,13,  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
Sonnet XCVI,0,"Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;"
Sonnet XCVI,1,Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
Sonnet XCVI,2,Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
Sonnet XCVI,3,Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
Sonnet XCVI,4,As on the finger of a throned queen
Sonnet XCVI,5,"The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,"
Sonnet XCVI,6,So are those errors that in thee are seen
Sonnet XCVI,7,To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
Sonnet XCVI,8,"How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,"
Sonnet XCVI,9,If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
Sonnet XCVI,10,"How many gazers mightst thou lead away,"
Sonnet XCVI,11,If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
Sonnet XCVI,12,  But do not so; I love thee in such sort
Sonnet XCVI,13,"  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
Sonnet XCVII,0,How like a winter hath my absence been
Sonnet XCVII,1,"From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!"
Sonnet XCVII,2,"What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!"
Sonnet XCVII,3,What old December's bareness every where!
Sonnet XCVII,4,"And yet this time removed was summer's time,"
Sonnet XCVII,5,"The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,"
Sonnet XCVII,6,"Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,"
Sonnet XCVII,7,Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Sonnet XCVII,8,Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
Sonnet XCVII,9,But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
Sonnet XCVII,10,"For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,"
Sonnet XCVII,11,"And, thou away, the very birds are mute;"
Sonnet XCVII,12,"  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer"
Sonnet XCVII,13,"  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
Sonnet XCVIII,0,"From you have I been absent in the spring,"
Sonnet XCVIII,1,When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
Sonnet XCVIII,2,"Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,"
Sonnet XCVIII,3,That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
Sonnet XCVIII,4,Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Sonnet XCVIII,5,Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Sonnet XCVIII,6,"Could make me any summer's story tell,"
Sonnet XCVIII,7,Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
Sonnet XCVIII,8,"Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,"
Sonnet XCVIII,9,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
Sonnet XCVIII,10,"They were but sweet, but figures of delight,"
Sonnet XCVIII,11,"Drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
Sonnet XCVIII,12,"  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,"
Sonnet XCVIII,13,  As with your shadow I with these did play:
Sonnet XCIX,0,The forward violet thus did I chide:
Sonnet XCIX,1,"Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,"
Sonnet XCIX,2,If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
Sonnet XCIX,3,Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
Sonnet XCIX,4,In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
Sonnet XCIX,5,"The lily I condemned for thy hand,"
Sonnet XCIX,6,And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:
Sonnet XCIX,7,"The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,"
Sonnet XCIX,8,"One blushing shame, another white despair;"
Sonnet XCIX,9,"A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both"
Sonnet XCIX,10,And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
Sonnet XCIX,11,"But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth"
Sonnet XCIX,12,A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
Sonnet XCIX,13,"  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see"
Sonnet XCIX,14,  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.
Sonnet C,0,"Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long"
Sonnet C,1,To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
Sonnet C,2,"Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,"
Sonnet C,3,Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
Sonnet C,4,"Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem"
Sonnet C,5,In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sonnet C,6,Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
Sonnet C,7,And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
Sonnet C,8,"Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,"
Sonnet C,9,If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
Sonnet C,10,"If any, be a satire to decay,"
Sonnet C,11,And make Time's spoils despised every where.
Sonnet C,12,  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
Sonnet C,13,  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
Sonnet CI,0,"O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends"
Sonnet CI,1,For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Sonnet CI,2,Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
Sonnet CI,3,"So dost thou too, and therein dignified."
Sonnet CI,4,"Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say"
Sonnet CI,5,"'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;"
Sonnet CI,6,"Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;"
Sonnet CI,7,"But best is best, if never intermix'd?'"
Sonnet CI,8,"Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?"
Sonnet CI,9,Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
Sonnet CI,10,"To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,"
Sonnet CI,11,And to be praised of ages yet to be.
Sonnet CI,12,"  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how"
Sonnet CI,13,  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
Sonnet CII,0,"My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;"
Sonnet CII,1,"I love not less, though less the show appear:"
Sonnet CII,2,That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
Sonnet CII,3,The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
Sonnet CII,4,Our love was new and then but in the spring
Sonnet CII,5,"When I was wont to greet it with my lays,"
Sonnet CII,6,As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
Sonnet CII,7,And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
Sonnet CII,8,Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Sonnet CII,9,"Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,"
Sonnet CII,10,But that wild music burthens every bough
Sonnet CII,11,And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
Sonnet CII,12,"  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,"
Sonnet CII,13,  Because I would not dull you with my song.
Sonnet CIII,0,"Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,"
Sonnet CIII,1,"That having such a scope to show her pride,"
Sonnet CIII,2,The argument all bare is of more worth
Sonnet CIII,3,Than when it hath my added praise beside!
Sonnet CIII,4,"O, blame me not, if I no more can write!"
Sonnet CIII,5,"Look in your glass, and there appears a face"
Sonnet CIII,6,"That over-goes my blunt invention quite,"
Sonnet CIII,7,Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
Sonnet CIII,8,"Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,"
Sonnet CIII,9,To mar the subject that before was well?
Sonnet CIII,10,For to no other pass my verses tend
Sonnet CIII,11,Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
Sonnet CIII,12,"  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit"
Sonnet CIII,13,  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
Sonnet CIV,0,"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,"
Sonnet CIV,1,"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,"
Sonnet CIV,2,Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Sonnet CIV,3,"Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,"
Sonnet CIV,4,Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
Sonnet CIV,5,"In process of the seasons have I seen,"
Sonnet CIV,6,"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,"
Sonnet CIV,7,"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green."
Sonnet CIV,8,"Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,"
Sonnet CIV,9,Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
Sonnet CIV,10,"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,"
Sonnet CIV,11,Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
Sonnet CIV,12,"  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;"
Sonnet CIV,13,  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
Sonnet CV,0,"Let not my love be call'd idolatry,"
Sonnet CV,1,"Nor my beloved as an idol show,"
Sonnet CV,2,Since all alike my songs and praises be
Sonnet CV,3,"To one, of one, still such, and ever so."
Sonnet CV,4,"Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,"
Sonnet CV,5,Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
Sonnet CV,6,"Therefore my verse to constancy confined,"
Sonnet CV,7,"One thing expressing, leaves out difference."
Sonnet CV,8,"'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,"
Sonnet CV,9,"'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;"
Sonnet CV,10,"And in this change is my invention spent,"
Sonnet CV,11,"Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords."
Sonnet CV,12,"  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,"
Sonnet CV,13,  Which three till now never kept seat in one.
Sonnet CVI,0,When in the chronicle of wasted time
Sonnet CVI,1,"I see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
Sonnet CVI,2,And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
Sonnet CVI,3,"In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,"
Sonnet CVI,4,"Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,"
Sonnet CVI,5,"Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
Sonnet CVI,6,I see their antique pen would have express'd
Sonnet CVI,7,Even such a beauty as you master now.
Sonnet CVI,8,So all their praises are but prophecies
Sonnet CVI,9,"Of this our time, all you prefiguring;"
Sonnet CVI,10,"And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,"
Sonnet CVI,11,They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
Sonnet CVI,12,"  For we, which now behold these present days,"
Sonnet CVI,13,"  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."
Sonnet CVII,0,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
Sonnet CVII,1,"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
Sonnet CVII,2,"Can yet the lease of my true love control,"
Sonnet CVII,3,Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
Sonnet CVII,4,The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
Sonnet CVII,5,And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Sonnet CVII,6,Incertainties now crown themselves assured
Sonnet CVII,7,And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Sonnet CVII,8,Now with the drops of this most balmy time
Sonnet CVII,9,"My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
Sonnet CVII,10,"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,"
Sonnet CVII,11,While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
Sonnet CVII,12,"  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
Sonnet CVII,13,  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
Sonnet CVIII,0,What's in the brain that ink may character
Sonnet CVIII,1,Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
Sonnet CVIII,2,"What's new to speak, what new to register,"
Sonnet CVIII,3,That may express my love or thy dear merit?
Sonnet CVIII,4,"Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,"
Sonnet CVIII,5,"I must, each day say o'er the very same,"
Sonnet CVIII,6,"Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,"
Sonnet CVIII,7,Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
Sonnet CVIII,8,So that eternal love in love's fresh case
Sonnet CVIII,9,"Weighs not the dust and injury of age,"
Sonnet CVIII,10,"Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,"
Sonnet CVIII,11,"But makes antiquity for aye his page,"
Sonnet CVIII,12,  Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Sonnet CVIII,13,  Where time and outward form would show it dead.
Sonnet CIX,0,"O, never say that I was false of heart,"
Sonnet CIX,1,Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
Sonnet CIX,2,As easy might I from myself depart
Sonnet CIX,3,"As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:"
Sonnet CIX,4,"That is my home of love: if I have ranged,"
Sonnet CIX,5,"Like him that travels I return again,"
Sonnet CIX,6,"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,"
Sonnet CIX,7,So that myself bring water for my stain.
Sonnet CIX,8,"Never believe, though in my nature reign'd"
Sonnet CIX,9,"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,"
Sonnet CIX,10,"That it could so preposterously be stain'd,"
Sonnet CIX,11,To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
Sonnet CIX,12,"  For nothing this wide universe I call,"
Sonnet CIX,13,"  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all."
Sonnet CX,0,"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there"
Sonnet CX,1,"And made myself a motley to the view,"
Sonnet CX,2,"Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,"
Sonnet CX,3,Made old offences of affections new;
Sonnet CX,4,Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
Sonnet CX,5,"Askance and strangely: but, by all above,"
Sonnet CX,6,"These blenches gave my heart another youth,"
Sonnet CX,7,And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
Sonnet CX,8,"Now all is done, have what shall have no end:"
Sonnet CX,9,Mine appetite I never more will grind
Sonnet CX,10,"On newer proof, to try an older friend,"
Sonnet CX,11,"A god in love, to whom I am confined."
Sonnet CX,12,"  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,"
Sonnet CX,13,  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
Sonnet CXI,0,"O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
Sonnet CXI,1,"The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
Sonnet CXI,2,That did not better for my life provide
Sonnet CXI,3,Than public means which public manners breeds.
Sonnet CXI,4,"Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
Sonnet CXI,5,And almost thence my nature is subdued
Sonnet CXI,6,"To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:"
Sonnet CXI,7,Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
Sonnet CXI,8,"Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink"
Sonnet CXI,9,Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
Sonnet CXI,10,"No bitterness that I will bitter think,"
Sonnet CXI,11,"Nor double penance, to correct correction."
Sonnet CXI,12,"  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye"
Sonnet CXI,13,  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
Sonnet CXII,0,Your love and pity doth the impression fill
Sonnet CXII,1,Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
Sonnet CXII,2,"For what care I who calls me well or ill,"
Sonnet CXII,3,"So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?"
Sonnet CXII,4,"You are my all the world, and I must strive"
Sonnet CXII,5,To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
Sonnet CXII,6,"None else to me, nor I to none alive,"
Sonnet CXII,7,That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
Sonnet CXII,8,In so profound abysm I throw all care
Sonnet CXII,9,"Of others' voices, that my adder's sense"
Sonnet CXII,10,To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
Sonnet CXII,11,Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
Sonnet CXII,12,  You are so strongly in my purpose bred
Sonnet CXII,13,  That all the world besides methinks are dead.
Sonnet CXIII,0,"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;"
Sonnet CXIII,1,And that which governs me to go about
Sonnet CXIII,2,"Doth part his function and is partly blind,"
Sonnet CXIII,3,"Seems seeing, but effectually is out;"
Sonnet CXIII,4,For it no form delivers to the heart
Sonnet CXIII,5,"Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:"
Sonnet CXIII,6,"Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,"
Sonnet CXIII,7,Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
Sonnet CXIII,8,"For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,"
Sonnet CXIII,9,"The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,"
Sonnet CXIII,10,"The mountain or the sea, the day or night,"
Sonnet CXIII,11,"The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:"
Sonnet CXIII,12,"  Incapable of more, replete with you,"
Sonnet CXIII,13,  My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.
Sonnet CXIV,0,"Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,"
Sonnet CXIV,1,"Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?"
Sonnet CXIV,2,"Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,"
Sonnet CXIV,3,"And that your love taught it this alchemy,"
Sonnet CXIV,4,To make of monsters and things indigest
Sonnet CXIV,5,"Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,"
Sonnet CXIV,6,"Creating every bad a perfect best,"
Sonnet CXIV,7,As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
Sonnet CXIV,8,"O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,"
Sonnet CXIV,9,And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
Sonnet CXIV,10,"Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,"
Sonnet CXIV,11,And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
Sonnet CXIV,12,"  If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin"
Sonnet CXIV,13,  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
Sonnet CXV,0,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,"
Sonnet CXV,1,Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
Sonnet CXV,2,Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
Sonnet CXV,3,My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
Sonnet CXV,4,"But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents"
Sonnet CXV,5,"Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,"
Sonnet CXV,6,"Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,"
Sonnet CXV,7,Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
Sonnet CXV,8,"Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,"
Sonnet CXV,9,"Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'"
Sonnet CXV,10,"When I was certain o'er incertainty,"
Sonnet CXV,11,"Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?"
Sonnet CXV,12,"  Love is a babe; then might I not say so,"
Sonnet CXV,13,  To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
Sonnet CXVI,0,Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Sonnet CXVI,1,Admit impediments. Love is not love
Sonnet CXVI,2,"Which alters when it alteration finds,"
Sonnet CXVI,3,Or bends with the remover to remove:
Sonnet CXVI,4,O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
Sonnet CXVI,5,That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
Sonnet CXVI,6,"It is the star to every wandering bark,"
Sonnet CXVI,7,"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Sonnet CXVI,8,"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
Sonnet CXVI,9,Within his bending sickle's compass come:
Sonnet CXVI,10,"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
Sonnet CXVI,11,But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
Sonnet CXVI,12,"  If this be error and upon me proved,"
Sonnet CXVI,13,"  I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
Sonnet CXVII,0,Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
Sonnet CXVII,1,"Wherein I should your great deserts repay,"
Sonnet CXVII,2,"Forgot upon your dearest love to call,"
Sonnet CXVII,3,Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
Sonnet CXVII,4,That I have frequent been with unknown minds
Sonnet CXVII,5,And given to time your own dear-purchased right
Sonnet CXVII,6,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Sonnet CXVII,7,Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
Sonnet CXVII,8,Book both my wilfulness and errors down
Sonnet CXVII,9,And on just proof surmise accumulate;
Sonnet CXVII,10,"Bring me within the level of your frown,"
Sonnet CXVII,11,But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
Sonnet CXVII,12,  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
Sonnet CXVII,13,  The constancy and virtue of your love.
Sonnet CXVIII,0,"Like as, to make our appetites more keen,"
Sonnet CXVIII,1,"With eager compounds we our palate urge,"
Sonnet CXVIII,2,"As, to prevent our maladies unseen,"
Sonnet CXVIII,3,"We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,"
Sonnet CXVIII,4,"Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,"
Sonnet CXVIII,5,To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
Sonnet CXVIII,6,"And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness"
Sonnet CXVIII,7,To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
Sonnet CXVIII,8,"Thus policy in love, to anticipate"
Sonnet CXVIII,9,"The ills that were not, grew to faults assured"
Sonnet CXVIII,10,And brought to medicine a healthful state
Sonnet CXVIII,11,"Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:"
Sonnet CXVIII,12,"  But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,"
Sonnet CXVIII,13,  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
Sonnet CXIX,0,"What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,"
Sonnet CXIX,1,"Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,"
Sonnet CXIX,2,"Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,"
Sonnet CXIX,3,Still losing when I saw myself to win!
Sonnet CXIX,4,"What wretched errors hath my heart committed,"
Sonnet CXIX,5,Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
Sonnet CXIX,6,How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
Sonnet CXIX,7,In the distraction of this madding fever!
Sonnet CXIX,8,O benefit of ill! now I find true
Sonnet CXIX,9,That better is by evil still made better;
Sonnet CXIX,10,"And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,"
Sonnet CXIX,11,"Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater."
Sonnet CXIX,12,  So I return rebuked to my content
Sonnet CXIX,13,  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
Sonnet CXX,0,"That you were once unkind befriends me now,"
Sonnet CXX,1,And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Sonnet CXX,2,"Needs must I under my transgression bow,"
Sonnet CXX,3,Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
Sonnet CXX,4,For if you were by my unkindness shaken
Sonnet CXX,5,"As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,"
Sonnet CXX,6,"And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken"
Sonnet CXX,7,To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
Sonnet CXX,8,"O, that our night of woe might have remember'd"
Sonnet CXX,9,"My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,"
Sonnet CXX,10,"And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd"
Sonnet CXX,11,The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
Sonnet CXX,12,  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
Sonnet CXX,13,"  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me."
Sonnet CXXI,0,"'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,"
Sonnet CXXI,1,"When not to be receives reproach of being,"
Sonnet CXXI,2,And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
Sonnet CXXI,3,Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
Sonnet CXXI,4,For why should others false adulterate eyes
Sonnet CXXI,5,Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Sonnet CXXI,6,"Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,"
Sonnet CXXI,7,Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
Sonnet CXXI,8,"No, I am that I am, and they that level"
Sonnet CXXI,9,At my abuses reckon up their own:
Sonnet CXXI,10,"I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;"
Sonnet CXXI,11,By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;
Sonnet CXXI,12,"  Unless this general evil they maintain,"
Sonnet CXXI,13,"  All men are bad, and in their badness reign."
Sonnet CXXII,0,"Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain"
Sonnet CXXII,1,"Full character'd with lasting memory,"
Sonnet CXXII,2,Which shall above that idle rank remain
Sonnet CXXII,3,"Beyond all date, even to eternity;"
Sonnet CXXII,4,"Or at the least, so long as brain and heart"
Sonnet CXXII,5,Have faculty by nature to subsist;
Sonnet CXXII,6,Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Sonnet CXXII,7,"Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd."
Sonnet CXXII,8,"That poor retention could not so much hold,"
Sonnet CXXII,9,Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
Sonnet CXXII,10,"Therefore to give them from me was I bold,"
Sonnet CXXII,11,To trust those tables that receive thee more:
Sonnet CXXII,12,  To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Sonnet CXXII,13,  Were to import forgetfulness in me.
Sonnet CXXIII,0,"No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:"
Sonnet CXXIII,1,Thy pyramids built up with newer might
Sonnet CXXIII,2,"To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;"
Sonnet CXXIII,3,They are but dressings of a former sight.
Sonnet CXXIII,4,"Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire"
Sonnet CXXIII,5,"What thou dost foist upon us that is old,"
Sonnet CXXIII,6,And rather make them born to our desire
Sonnet CXXIII,7,Than think that we before have heard them told.
Sonnet CXXIII,8,"Thy registers and thee I both defy,"
Sonnet CXXIII,9,"Not wondering at the present nor the past,"
Sonnet CXXIII,10,"For thy records and what we see doth lie,"
Sonnet CXXIII,11,Made more or less by thy continual haste.
Sonnet CXXIII,12,  This I do vow and this shall ever be;
Sonnet CXXIII,13,"  I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee."
Sonnet CXXIV,0,"If my dear love were but the child of state,"
Sonnet CXXIV,1,It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
Sonnet CXXIV,2,"As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,"
Sonnet CXXIV,3,"Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd."
Sonnet CXXIV,4,"No, it was builded far from accident;"
Sonnet CXXIV,5,"It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls"
Sonnet CXXIV,6,"Under the blow of thralled discontent,"
Sonnet CXXIV,7,Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:
Sonnet CXXIV,8,"It fears not policy, that heretic,"
Sonnet CXXIV,9,"Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,"
Sonnet CXXIV,10,"But all alone stands hugely politic,"
Sonnet CXXIV,11,That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.
Sonnet CXXIV,12,"  To this I witness call the fools of time,"
Sonnet CXXIV,13,"  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime."
Sonnet CXXV,0,"Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,"
Sonnet CXXV,1,"With my extern the outward honouring,"
Sonnet CXXV,2,"Or laid great bases for eternity,"
Sonnet CXXV,3,Which prove more short than waste or ruining?
Sonnet CXXV,4,Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Sonnet CXXV,5,"Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,"
Sonnet CXXV,6,"For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,"
Sonnet CXXV,7,"Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?"
Sonnet CXXV,8,"No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,"
Sonnet CXXV,9,"And take thou my oblation, poor but free,"
Sonnet CXXV,10,"Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,"
Sonnet CXXV,11,"But mutual render, only me for thee."
Sonnet CXXV,12,"  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul"
Sonnet CXXV,13,  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.
Sonnet CXXVI,0,"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power"
Sonnet CXXVI,1,"Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;"
Sonnet CXXVI,2,"Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st"
Sonnet CXXVI,3,Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
Sonnet CXXVI,4,"If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,"
Sonnet CXXVI,5,"As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,"
Sonnet CXXVI,6,"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill"
Sonnet CXXVI,7,May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
Sonnet CXXVI,8,"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!"
Sonnet CXXVI,9,"She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:"
Sonnet CXXVI,10,"  Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,"
Sonnet CXXVI,11,  And her quietus is to render thee.
Sonnet CXXVII,0,"In the old age black was not counted fair,"
Sonnet CXXVII,1,"Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;"
Sonnet CXXVII,2,"But now is black beauty's successive heir,"
Sonnet CXXVII,3,And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
Sonnet CXXVII,4,"For since each hand hath put on nature's power,"
Sonnet CXXVII,5,"Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,"
Sonnet CXXVII,6,"Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,"
Sonnet CXXVII,7,"But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace."
Sonnet CXXVII,8,"Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,"
Sonnet CXXVII,9,"Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem"
Sonnet CXXVII,10,"At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,"
Sonnet CXXVII,11,Slandering creation with a false esteem:
Sonnet CXXVII,12,"  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,"
Sonnet CXXVII,13,  That every tongue says beauty should look so.
Sonnet CXXVIII,0,"How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,1,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
Sonnet CXXVIII,2,"With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st"
Sonnet CXXVIII,3,"The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,4,Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
Sonnet CXXVIII,5,"To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,6,"Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,7,At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
Sonnet CXXVIII,8,"To be so tickled, they would change their state"
Sonnet CXXVIII,9,"And situation with those dancing chips,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,10,"O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,11,Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
Sonnet CXXVIII,12,"  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,13,"  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
Sonnet CXXIX,0,The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Sonnet CXXIX,1,"Is lust in action; and till action, lust"
Sonnet CXXIX,2,"Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,"
Sonnet CXXIX,3,"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,"
Sonnet CXXIX,4,"Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,"
Sonnet CXXIX,5,"Past reason hunted, and no sooner had"
Sonnet CXXIX,6,"Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait"
Sonnet CXXIX,7,On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
Sonnet CXXIX,8,Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Sonnet CXXIX,9,"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;"
Sonnet CXXIX,10,"A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;"
Sonnet CXXIX,11,"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream."
Sonnet CXXIX,12,  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
Sonnet CXXIX,13,  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
Sonnet CXXX,0,My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Sonnet CXXX,1,Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
Sonnet CXXX,2,"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
Sonnet CXXX,3,"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head."
Sonnet CXXX,4,"I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,"
Sonnet CXXX,5,But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
Sonnet CXXX,6,And in some perfumes is there more delight
Sonnet CXXX,7,Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
Sonnet CXXX,8,"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know"
Sonnet CXXX,9,That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
Sonnet CXXX,10,I grant I never saw a goddess go;
Sonnet CXXX,11,"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:"
Sonnet CXXX,12,"  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare"
Sonnet CXXX,13,  As any she belied with false compare.
Sonnet CXXXI,0,"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,"
Sonnet CXXXI,1,As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
Sonnet CXXXI,2,For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Sonnet CXXXI,3,Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Sonnet CXXXI,4,"Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold"
Sonnet CXXXI,5,Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
Sonnet CXXXI,6,"To say they err I dare not be so bold,"
Sonnet CXXXI,7,Although I swear it to myself alone.
Sonnet CXXXI,8,"And, to be sure that is not false I swear,"
Sonnet CXXXI,9,"A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,"
Sonnet CXXXI,10,"One on another's neck, do witness bear"
Sonnet CXXXI,11,Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
Sonnet CXXXI,12,"  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,"
Sonnet CXXXI,13,"  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds."
Sonnet CXXXII,0,"Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,"
Sonnet CXXXII,1,"Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,"
Sonnet CXXXII,2,"Have put on black and loving mourners be,"
Sonnet CXXXII,3,Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
Sonnet CXXXII,4,And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Sonnet CXXXII,5,"Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,"
Sonnet CXXXII,6,Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Sonnet CXXXII,7,"Doth half that glory to the sober west,"
Sonnet CXXXII,8,As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
Sonnet CXXXII,9,"O, let it then as well beseem thy heart"
Sonnet CXXXII,10,"To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,"
Sonnet CXXXII,11,And suit thy pity like in every part.
Sonnet CXXXII,12,  Then will I swear beauty herself is black
Sonnet CXXXII,13,  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
Sonnet CXXXIII,0,Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
Sonnet CXXXIII,1,For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
Sonnet CXXXIII,2,"Is't not enough to torture me alone,"
Sonnet CXXXIII,3,But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
Sonnet CXXXIII,4,"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,"
Sonnet CXXXIII,5,And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
Sonnet CXXXIII,6,"Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;"
Sonnet CXXXIII,7,A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
Sonnet CXXXIII,8,"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,"
Sonnet CXXXIII,9,But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Sonnet CXXXIII,10,"Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;"
Sonnet CXXXIII,11,Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:
Sonnet CXXXIII,12,"  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,"
Sonnet CXXXIII,13,"  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me."
Sonnet CXXXIV,0,"So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,1,"And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,2,"Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine"
Sonnet CXXXIV,3,"Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:"
Sonnet CXXXIV,4,"But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,5,For thou art covetous and he is kind;
Sonnet CXXXIV,6,He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
Sonnet CXXXIV,7,Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
Sonnet CXXXIV,8,"The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,9,"Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,10,And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
Sonnet CXXXIV,11,So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
Sonnet CXXXIV,12,  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
Sonnet CXXXIV,13,"  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free."
Sonnet CXXXV,0,"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'"
Sonnet CXXXV,1,"And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;"
Sonnet CXXXV,2,"More than enough am I that vex thee still,"
Sonnet CXXXV,3,To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Sonnet CXXXV,4,"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,"
Sonnet CXXXV,5,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
Sonnet CXXXV,6,"Shall will in others seem right gracious,"
Sonnet CXXXV,7,And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
Sonnet CXXXV,8,"The sea all water, yet receives rain still"
Sonnet CXXXV,9,And in abundance addeth to his store;
Sonnet CXXXV,10,"So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'"
Sonnet CXXXV,11,"One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more."
Sonnet CXXXV,12,"  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;"
Sonnet CXXXV,13,"  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'"
Sonnet CXXXVI,0,"If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,"
Sonnet CXXXVI,1,"Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'"
Sonnet CXXXVI,2,"And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;"
Sonnet CXXXVI,3,"Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil."
Sonnet CXXXVI,4,"'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,"
Sonnet CXXXVI,5,"Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one."
Sonnet CXXXVI,6,In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Sonnet CXXXVI,7,Among a number one is reckon'd none:
Sonnet CXXXVI,8,"Then in the number let me pass untold,"
Sonnet CXXXVI,9,Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
Sonnet CXXXVI,10,"For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold"
Sonnet CXXXVI,11,"That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:"
Sonnet CXXXVI,12,"  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,"
Sonnet CXXXVI,13,"  And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'"
Sonnet CXXXVII,0,"Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,1,"That they behold, and see not what they see?"
Sonnet CXXXVII,2,"They know what beauty is, see where it lies,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,3,Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
Sonnet CXXXVII,4,If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
Sonnet CXXXVII,5,"Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,6,"Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,7,Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
Sonnet CXXXVII,8,Why should my heart think that a several plot
Sonnet CXXXVII,9,Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
Sonnet CXXXVII,10,"Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,11,To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
Sonnet CXXXVII,12,"  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,13,  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.
Sonnet CXXXVIII,0,When my love swears that she is made of truth
Sonnet CXXXVIII,1,"I do believe her, though I know she lies,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,2,"That she might think me some untutor'd youth,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,3,Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
Sonnet CXXXVIII,4,"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,5,"Although she knows my days are past the best,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,6,Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
Sonnet CXXXVIII,7,On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
Sonnet CXXXVIII,8,But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
Sonnet CXXXVIII,9,And wherefore say not I that I am old?
Sonnet CXXXVIII,10,"O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,11,And age in love loves not to have years told:
Sonnet CXXXVIII,12,"  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,13,  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.
Sonnet CXXXIX,0,"O, call not me to justify the wrong"
Sonnet CXXXIX,1,That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Sonnet CXXXIX,2,Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Sonnet CXXXIX,3,Use power with power and slay me not by art.
Sonnet CXXXIX,4,"Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,"
Sonnet CXXXIX,5,"Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:"
Sonnet CXXXIX,6,What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Sonnet CXXXIX,7,Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
Sonnet CXXXIX,8,Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
Sonnet CXXXIX,9,"Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,"
Sonnet CXXXIX,10,"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,"
Sonnet CXXXIX,11,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
Sonnet CXXXIX,12,"  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,"
Sonnet CXXXIX,13,  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
Sonnet CXL,0,Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
Sonnet CXL,1,My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
Sonnet CXL,2,Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
Sonnet CXL,3,The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
Sonnet CXL,4,"If I might teach thee wit, better it were,"
Sonnet CXL,5,"Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;"
Sonnet CXL,6,"As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,"
Sonnet CXL,7,No news but health from their physicians know;
Sonnet CXL,8,"For if I should despair, I should grow mad,"
Sonnet CXL,9,And in my madness might speak ill of thee:
Sonnet CXL,10,"Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,"
Sonnet CXL,11,"Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,"
Sonnet CXL,12,"  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,"
Sonnet CXL,13,"  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide."
Sonnet CXLI,0,"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,"
Sonnet CXLI,1,For they in thee a thousand errors note;
Sonnet CXLI,2,"But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,"
Sonnet CXLI,3,Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
Sonnet CXLI,4,"Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,"
Sonnet CXLI,5,"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,"
Sonnet CXLI,6,"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited"
Sonnet CXLI,7,To any sensual feast with thee alone:
Sonnet CXLI,8,But my five wits nor my five senses can
Sonnet CXLI,9,"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,"
Sonnet CXLI,10,"Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,"
Sonnet CXLI,11,Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
Sonnet CXLI,12,"  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,"
Sonnet CXLI,13,  That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
Sonnet CXLII,0,"Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,"
Sonnet CXLII,1,"Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:"
Sonnet CXLII,2,"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,"
Sonnet CXLII,3,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Sonnet CXLII,4,"Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,"
Sonnet CXLII,5,That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
Sonnet CXLII,6,"And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,"
Sonnet CXLII,7,Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Sonnet CXLII,8,"Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those"
Sonnet CXLII,9,Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Sonnet CXLII,10,"Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows"
Sonnet CXLII,11,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
Sonnet CXLII,12,"  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,"
Sonnet CXLII,13,  By self-example mayst thou be denied!
Sonnet CXLIII,0,Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
Sonnet CXLIII,1,"One of her feather'd creatures broke away,"
Sonnet CXLIII,2,Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
Sonnet CXLIII,3,"In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,"
Sonnet CXLIII,4,"Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,"
Sonnet CXLIII,5,Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
Sonnet CXLIII,6,"To follow that which flies before her face,"
Sonnet CXLIII,7,Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
Sonnet CXLIII,8,"So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,"
Sonnet CXLIII,9,Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
Sonnet CXLIII,10,"But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,"
Sonnet CXLIII,11,"And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:"
Sonnet CXLIII,12,"  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'"
Sonnet CXLIII,13,"  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still."
Sonnet CXLIV,0,"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,"
Sonnet CXLIV,1,Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
Sonnet CXLIV,2,"The better angel is a man right fair,"
Sonnet CXLIV,3,The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
Sonnet CXLIV,4,"To win me soon to hell, my female evil"
Sonnet CXLIV,5,"Tempteth my better angel from my side,"
Sonnet CXLIV,6,"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,"
Sonnet CXLIV,7,Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
Sonnet CXLIV,8,And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
Sonnet CXLIV,9,"Suspect I may, but not directly tell;"
Sonnet CXLIV,10,"But being both from me, both to each friend,"
Sonnet CXLIV,11,I guess one angel in another's hell:
Sonnet CXLIV,12,"  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,"
Sonnet CXLIV,13,  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
Sonnet CXLV,0,Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Sonnet CXLV,1,Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
Sonnet CXLV,2,To me that languish'd for her sake;
Sonnet CXLV,3,"But when she saw my woeful state,"
Sonnet CXLV,4,"Straight in her heart did mercy come,"
Sonnet CXLV,5,Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Sonnet CXLV,6,"Was used in giving gentle doom,"
Sonnet CXLV,7,And taught it thus anew to greet:
Sonnet CXLV,8,"'I hate' she alter'd with an end,"
Sonnet CXLV,9,That follow'd it as gentle day
Sonnet CXLV,10,"Doth follow night, who like a fiend"
Sonnet CXLV,11,From heaven to hell is flown away;
Sonnet CXLV,12,"  'I hate' from hate away she threw,"
Sonnet CXLV,13,"  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'"
Sonnet CXLVI,0,"Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,"
Sonnet CXLVI,1,[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;
Sonnet CXLVI,2,"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
Sonnet CXLVI,3,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Sonnet CXLVI,4,"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,"
Sonnet CXLVI,5,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Sonnet CXLVI,6,"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,"
Sonnet CXLVI,7,Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
Sonnet CXLVI,8,"Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,"
Sonnet CXLVI,9,And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Sonnet CXLVI,10,Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Sonnet CXLVI,11,"Within be fed, without be rich no more:"
Sonnet CXLVI,12,"  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,"
Sonnet CXLVI,13,"  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then."
Sonnet CXLVII,0,"My love is as a fever, longing still"
Sonnet CXLVII,1,"For that which longer nurseth the disease,"
Sonnet CXLVII,2,"Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,"
Sonnet CXLVII,3,The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
Sonnet CXLVII,4,"My reason, the physician to my love,"
Sonnet CXLVII,5,"Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,"
Sonnet CXLVII,6,"Hath left me, and I desperate now approve"
Sonnet CXLVII,7,"Desire is death, which physic did except."
Sonnet CXLVII,8,"Past cure I am, now reason is past care,"
Sonnet CXLVII,9,And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
Sonnet CXLVII,10,"My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,"
Sonnet CXLVII,11,At random from the truth vainly express'd;
Sonnet CXLVII,12,"  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,"
Sonnet CXLVII,13,"  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
Sonnet CXLVIII,0,"O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,"
Sonnet CXLVIII,1,Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Sonnet CXLVIII,2,"Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,"
Sonnet CXLVIII,3,That censures falsely what they see aright?
Sonnet CXLVIII,4,"If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,"
Sonnet CXLVIII,5,What means the world to say it is not so?
Sonnet CXLVIII,6,"If it be not, then love doth well denote"
Sonnet CXLVIII,7,Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
Sonnet CXLVIII,8,"How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,"
Sonnet CXLVIII,9,That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
Sonnet CXLVIII,10,"No marvel then, though I mistake my view;"
Sonnet CXLVIII,11,The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
Sonnet CXLVIII,12,"  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,"
Sonnet CXLVIII,13,  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
Sonnet CXLIX,0,"Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,"
Sonnet CXLIX,1,When I against myself with thee partake?
Sonnet CXLIX,2,"Do I not think on thee, when I forgot"
Sonnet CXLIX,3,"Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?"
Sonnet CXLIX,4,Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
Sonnet CXLIX,5,On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
Sonnet CXLIX,6,"Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend"
Sonnet CXLIX,7,Revenge upon myself with present moan?
Sonnet CXLIX,8,"What merit do I in myself respect,"
Sonnet CXLIX,9,"That is so proud thy service to despise,"
Sonnet CXLIX,10,"When all my best doth worship thy defect,"
Sonnet CXLIX,11,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
Sonnet CXLIX,12,"  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;"
Sonnet CXLIX,13,"  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind."
Sonnet CL,0,"O, from what power hast thou this powerful might"
Sonnet CL,1,With insufficiency my heart to sway?
Sonnet CL,2,"To make me give the lie to my true sight,"
Sonnet CL,3,And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Sonnet CL,4,"Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,"
Sonnet CL,5,That in the very refuse of thy deeds
Sonnet CL,6,There is such strength and warrantize of skill
Sonnet CL,7,"That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?"
Sonnet CL,8,Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
Sonnet CL,9,The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
Sonnet CL,10,"O, though I love what others do abhor,"
Sonnet CL,11,With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
Sonnet CL,12,"  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,"
Sonnet CL,13,  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
Sonnet CLI,0,Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Sonnet CLI,1,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Sonnet CLI,2,"Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,"
Sonnet CLI,3,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
Sonnet CLI,4,"For, thou betraying me, I do betray"
Sonnet CLI,5,My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
Sonnet CLI,6,My soul doth tell my body that he may
Sonnet CLI,7,Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
Sonnet CLI,8,"But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee"
Sonnet CLI,9,"As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,"
Sonnet CLI,10,"He is contented thy poor drudge to be,"
Sonnet CLI,11,"To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side."
Sonnet CLI,12,  No want of conscience hold it that I call
Sonnet CLI,13,  Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
Sonnet CLII,0,"In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,"
Sonnet CLII,1,"But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,"
Sonnet CLII,2,"In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,"
Sonnet CLII,3,In vowing new hate after new love bearing.
Sonnet CLII,4,"But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,"
Sonnet CLII,5,When I break twenty? I am perjured most;
Sonnet CLII,6,For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
Sonnet CLII,7,"And all my honest faith in thee is lost,"
Sonnet CLII,8,"For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,"
Sonnet CLII,9,"Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,"
Sonnet CLII,10,"And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,"
Sonnet CLII,11,Or made them swear against the thing they see;
Sonnet CLII,12,"  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,"
Sonnet CLII,13,  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!
Sonnet CLIII,0,"Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:"
Sonnet CLIII,1,"A maid of Dian's this advantage found,"
Sonnet CLIII,2,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
Sonnet CLIII,3,In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
Sonnet CLIII,4,Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
Sonnet CLIII,5,"A dateless lively heat, still to endure,"
Sonnet CLIII,6,"And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove"
Sonnet CLIII,7,Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
Sonnet CLIII,8,"But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,"
Sonnet CLIII,9,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
Sonnet CLIII,10,"I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,"
Sonnet CLIII,11,"And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,"
Sonnet CLIII,12,  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
Sonnet CLIII,13,  Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
Sonnet CLIV,0,The little Love-god lying once asleep
Sonnet CLIV,1,"Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
Sonnet CLIV,2,Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Sonnet CLIV,3,Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
Sonnet CLIV,4,The fairest votary took up that fire
Sonnet CLIV,5,Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
Sonnet CLIV,6,And so the general of hot desire
Sonnet CLIV,7,Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
Sonnet CLIV,8,"This brand she quenched in a cool well by,"
Sonnet CLIV,9,"Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,"
Sonnet CLIV,10,Growing a bath and healthful remedy
Sonnet CLIV,11,"For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,"
Sonnet CLIV,12,"  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,"
Sonnet CLIV,13,"  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love."
