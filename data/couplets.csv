Sonnet I,0,"FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,/That thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
Sonnet I,1,"But as the riper should by time decease,/His tender heir might bear his memory:"
Sonnet I,2,"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,/Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,"
Sonnet I,3,"Making a famine where abundance lies,/Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel."
Sonnet I,4,"Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament/And only herald to the gaudy spring,"
Sonnet I,5,"Within thine own bud buriest thy content/And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding."
Sonnet I,6,"  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,/  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
Sonnet II,0,"When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,/And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
Sonnet II,1,"Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,/Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:"
Sonnet II,2,"Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,/Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"
Sonnet II,3,"To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,/Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise."
Sonnet II,4,"How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,/If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine"
Sonnet II,5,"Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'/Proving his beauty by succession thine!"
Sonnet II,6,"  This were to be new made when thou art old,/  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold."
Sonnet III,0,"Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest/Now is the time that face should form another;"
Sonnet III,1,"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,/Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
Sonnet III,2,For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb/Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Sonnet III,3,"Or who is he so fond will be the tomb/Of his self-love, to stop posterity?"
Sonnet III,4,"Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee/Calls back the lovely April of her prime:"
Sonnet III,5,So thou through windows of thine age shall see/Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
Sonnet III,6,"  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,/  Die single, and thine image dies with thee."
Sonnet IV,0,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend/Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?"
Sonnet IV,1,"Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,/And being frank she lends to those are free."
Sonnet IV,2,"Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse/The bounteous largess given thee to give?"
Sonnet IV,3,"Profitless usurer, why dost thou use/So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
Sonnet IV,4,"For having traffic with thyself alone,/Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive."
Sonnet IV,5,"Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,/What acceptable audit canst thou leave?"
Sonnet IV,6,"  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,/  Which, used, lives th' executor to be."
Sonnet V,0,"Those hours, that with gentle work did frame/The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
Sonnet V,1,Will play the tyrants to the very same/And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
Sonnet V,2,For never-resting time leads summer on/To hideous winter and confounds him there;
Sonnet V,3,"Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,/Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:"
Sonnet V,4,"Then, were not summer's distillation left,/A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
Sonnet V,5,"Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,/Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:"
Sonnet V,6,"  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,/  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet."
Sonnet VI,0,"Then let not winter's ragged hand deface/In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:"
Sonnet VI,1,"Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place/With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd."
Sonnet VI,2,"That use is not forbidden usury,/Which happies those that pay the willing loan;"
Sonnet VI,3,"That's for thyself to breed another thee,/Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;"
Sonnet VI,4,"Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,/If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:"
Sonnet VI,5,"Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,/Leaving thee living in posterity?"
Sonnet VI,6,"  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair/  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir."
Sonnet VII,0,"Lo! in the orient when the gracious light/Lifts up his burning head, each under eye"
Sonnet VII,1,"Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,/Serving with looks his sacred majesty;"
Sonnet VII,2,"And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,/Resembling strong youth in his middle age,"
Sonnet VII,3,"yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,/Attending on his golden pilgrimage;"
Sonnet VII,4,"But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,/Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,"
Sonnet VII,5,"The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are/From his low tract and look another way:"
Sonnet VII,6,"  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,/  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son."
Sonnet VIII,0,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?/Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy."
Sonnet VIII,1,"Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,/Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?"
Sonnet VIII,2,"If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,/By unions married, do offend thine ear,"
Sonnet VIII,3,"They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds/In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear."
Sonnet VIII,4,"Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,/Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,"
Sonnet VIII,5,"Resembling sire and child and happy mother/Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:"
Sonnet VIII,6,"  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,/  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'"
Sonnet IX,0,Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye/That thou consumest thyself in single life?
Sonnet IX,1,"Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die./The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;"
Sonnet IX,2,"The world will be thy widow and still weep/That thou no form of thee hast left behind,"
Sonnet IX,3,When every private widow well may keep/By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
Sonnet IX,4,"Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend/Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;"
Sonnet IX,5,"But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,/And kept unused, the user so destroys it."
Sonnet IX,6,  No love toward others in that bosom sits/  That on himself such murderous shame commits.
Sonnet X,0,"For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,/Who for thyself art so unprovident."
Sonnet X,1,"Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,/But that thou none lovest is most evident;"
Sonnet X,2,For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate/That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
Sonnet X,3,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate/Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Sonnet X,4,"O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!/Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?"
Sonnet X,5,"Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,/Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:"
Sonnet X,6,"  Make thee another self, for love of me,/  That beauty still may live in thine or thee."
Sonnet XI,0,"As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest/In one of thine, from that which thou departest;"
Sonnet XI,1,And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest/Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
Sonnet XI,2,"Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:/Without this, folly, age and cold decay:"
Sonnet XI,3,"If all were minded so, the times should cease/And threescore year would make the world away."
Sonnet XI,4,"Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,/Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:"
Sonnet XI,5,"Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;/Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:"
Sonnet XI,6,"  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby/  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die."
Sonnet XII,0,"When I do count the clock that tells the time,/And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;"
Sonnet XII,1,"When I behold the violet past prime,/And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;"
Sonnet XII,2,"When lofty trees I see barren of leaves/Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,"
Sonnet XII,3,"And summer's green all girded up in sheaves/Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,"
Sonnet XII,4,"Then of thy beauty do I question make,/That thou among the wastes of time must go,"
Sonnet XII,5,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake/And die as fast as they see others grow;
Sonnet XII,6,"  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence/  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence."
Sonnet XIII,0,"O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are/No longer yours than you yourself here live:"
Sonnet XIII,1,"Against this coming end you should prepare,/And your sweet semblance to some other give."
Sonnet XIII,2,So should that beauty which you hold in lease/Find no determination: then you were
Sonnet XIII,3,"Yourself again after yourself's decease,/When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear."
Sonnet XIII,4,"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,/Which husbandry in honour might uphold"
Sonnet XIII,5,Against the stormy gusts of winter's day/And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
Sonnet XIII,6,"  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know/  You had a father: let your son say so."
Sonnet XIV,0,"Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;/And yet methinks I have astronomy,"
Sonnet XIV,1,"But not to tell of good or evil luck,/Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;"
Sonnet XIV,2,"Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,/Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,"
Sonnet XIV,3,"Or say with princes if it shall go well,/By oft predict that I in heaven find:"
Sonnet XIV,4,"But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,/And, constant stars, in them I read such art"
Sonnet XIV,5,"As truth and beauty shall together thrive,/If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;"
Sonnet XIV,6,  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:/  Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Sonnet XV,0,"When I consider every thing that grows/Holds in perfection but a little moment,"
Sonnet XV,1,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows/Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
Sonnet XV,2,"When I perceive that men as plants increase,/Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,"
Sonnet XV,3,"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,/And wear their brave state out of memory;"
Sonnet XV,4,"Then the conceit of this inconstant stay/Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
Sonnet XV,5,"Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,/To change your day of youth to sullied night;"
Sonnet XV,6,"  And all in war with Time for love of you,/  As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
Sonnet XVI,0,"But wherefore do not you a mightier way/Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?"
Sonnet XVI,1,And fortify yourself in your decay/With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Sonnet XVI,2,"Now stand you on the top of happy hours,/And many maiden gardens yet unset"
Sonnet XVI,3,"With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,/Much liker than your painted counterfeit:"
Sonnet XVI,4,"So should the lines of life that life repair,/Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,"
Sonnet XVI,5,"Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,/Can make you live yourself in eyes of men."
Sonnet XVI,6,"  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,/  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill."
Sonnet XVII,0,"Who will believe my verse in time to come,/If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?"
Sonnet XVII,1,"Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb/Which hides your life and shows not half your parts."
Sonnet XVII,2,"If I could write the beauty of your eyes/And in fresh numbers number all your graces,"
Sonnet XVII,3,The age to come would say 'This poet lies:/Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
Sonnet XVII,4,"So should my papers yellow'd with their age/Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,"
Sonnet XVII,5,And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage/And stretched metre of an antique song:
Sonnet XVII,6,"  But were some child of yours alive that time,/  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme."
Sonnet XVIII,0,Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Sonnet XVIII,1,"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,/And summer's lease hath all too short a date:"
Sonnet XVIII,2,"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,/And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;"
Sonnet XVIII,3,"And every fair from fair sometime declines,/By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;"
Sonnet XVIII,4,But thy eternal summer shall not fade/Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Sonnet XVIII,5,"Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,/When in eternal lines to time thou growest:"
Sonnet XVIII,6,"  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,/  So long lives this and this gives life to thee."
Sonnet XIX,0,"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,/And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;"
Sonnet XIX,1,"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,/And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;"
Sonnet XIX,2,"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,/And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,"
Sonnet XIX,3,To the wide world and all her fading sweets;/But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
Sonnet XIX,4,"O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,/Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;"
Sonnet XIX,5,Him in thy course untainted do allow/For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Sonnet XIX,6,"  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,/  My love shall in my verse ever live young."
Sonnet XX,0,"A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted/Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;"
Sonnet XX,1,"A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted/With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;"
Sonnet XX,2,"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,/Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;"
Sonnet XX,3,"A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,/Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth."
Sonnet XX,4,"And for a woman wert thou first created;/Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,"
Sonnet XX,5,"And by addition me of thee defeated,/By adding one thing to my purpose nothing."
Sonnet XX,6,"  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,/  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure."
Sonnet XXI,0,"So is it not with me as with that Muse/Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,"
Sonnet XXI,1,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use/And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Sonnet XXI,2,"Making a couplement of proud compare,/With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,"
Sonnet XXI,3,"With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare/That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems."
Sonnet XXI,4,"O' let me, true in love, but truly write,/And then believe me, my love is as fair"
Sonnet XXI,5,"As any mother's child, though not so bright/As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:"
Sonnet XXI,6,  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;/  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
Sonnet XXII,0,"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,/So long as youth and thou are of one date;"
Sonnet XXII,1,"But when in thee time's furrows I behold,/Then look I death my days should expiate."
Sonnet XXII,2,"For all that beauty that doth cover thee/Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,"
Sonnet XXII,3,"Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:/How can I then be elder than thou art?"
Sonnet XXII,4,"O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary/As I, not for myself, but for thee will;"
Sonnet XXII,5,"Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary/As tender nurse her babe from faring ill."
Sonnet XXII,6,"  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;/  Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again."
Sonnet XXIII,0,"As an unperfect actor on the stage/Who with his fear is put besides his part,"
Sonnet XXIII,1,"Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,/Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart."
Sonnet XXIII,2,"So I, for fear of trust, forget to say/The perfect ceremony of love's rite,"
Sonnet XXIII,3,"And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,/O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might."
Sonnet XXIII,4,"O, let my books be then the eloquence/And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,"
Sonnet XXIII,5,Who plead for love and look for recompense/More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
Sonnet XXIII,6,"  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:/  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit."
Sonnet XXIV,0,Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd/Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
Sonnet XXIV,1,"My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,/And perspective it is the painter's art."
Sonnet XXIV,2,"For through the painter must you see his skill,/To find where your true image pictured lies;"
Sonnet XXIV,3,"Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,/That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes."
Sonnet XXIV,4,"Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:/Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me"
Sonnet XXIV,5,"Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun/Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;"
Sonnet XXIV,6,"  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;/  They draw but what they see, know not the heart."
Sonnet XXV,0,"Let those who are in favour with their stars/Of public honour and proud titles boast,"
Sonnet XXV,1,"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,/Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most."
Sonnet XXV,2,"Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread/But as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
Sonnet XXV,3,"And in themselves their pride lies buried,/For at a frown they in their glory die."
Sonnet XXV,4,"The painful warrior famoused for fight,/After a thousand victories once foil'd,"
Sonnet XXV,5,"Is from the book of honour razed quite,/And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:"
Sonnet XXV,6,"  Then happy I, that love and am beloved/  Where I may not remove nor be removed."
Sonnet XXVI,0,"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage/Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,"
Sonnet XXVI,1,"To thee I send this written embassage,/To witness duty, not to show my wit:"
Sonnet XXVI,2,"Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine/May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,"
Sonnet XXVI,3,"But that I hope some good conceit of thine/In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;"
Sonnet XXVI,4,Till whatsoever star that guides my moving/Points on me graciously with fair aspect
Sonnet XXVI,5,"And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,/To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:"
Sonnet XXVI,6,  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;/  Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
Sonnet XXVII,0,"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,/The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;"
Sonnet XXVII,1,"But then begins a journey in my head,/To work my mind, when body's work's expired:"
Sonnet XXVII,2,"For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,/Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,"
Sonnet XXVII,3,"And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,/Looking on darkness which the blind do see"
Sonnet XXVII,4,"Save that my soul's imaginary sight/Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,"
Sonnet XXVII,5,"Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,/Makes black night beauteous and her old face new."
Sonnet XXVII,6,"  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,/  For thee and for myself no quiet find."
Sonnet XXVIII,0,"How can I then return in happy plight,/That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?"
Sonnet XXVIII,1,"When day's oppression is not eased by night,/But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?"
Sonnet XXVIII,2,"And each, though enemies to either's reign,/Do in consent shake hands to torture me;"
Sonnet XXVIII,3,"The one by toil, the other to complain/How far I toil, still farther off from thee."
Sonnet XXVIII,4,"I tell the day, to please them thou art bright/And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:"
Sonnet XXVIII,5,"So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,/When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even."
Sonnet XXVIII,6,But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer/  And night doth nightly make grief's strength
Sonnet XXVIII,7,  	seem stronger./
Sonnet XXIX,0,"When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,/I all alone beweep my outcast state"
Sonnet XXIX,1,"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries/And look upon myself and curse my fate,"
Sonnet XXIX,2,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,/Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,"
Sonnet XXIX,3,"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,/With what I most enjoy contented least;"
Sonnet XXIX,4,"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,/Haply I think on thee, and then my state,"
Sonnet XXIX,5,"Like to the lark at break of day arising/From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;"
Sonnet XXIX,6,  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings/  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
Sonnet XXX,0,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought/I summon up remembrance of things past,"
Sonnet XXX,1,"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,/And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:"
Sonnet XXX,2,"Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,/For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,"
Sonnet XXX,3,"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,/And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:"
Sonnet XXX,4,"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,/And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er"
Sonnet XXX,5,"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,/Which I new pay as if not paid before."
Sonnet XXX,6,"  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,/  All losses are restored and sorrows end."
Sonnet XXXI,0,"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,/Which I by lacking have supposed dead,"
Sonnet XXXI,1,"And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,/And all those friends which I thought buried."
Sonnet XXXI,2,How many a holy and obsequious tear/Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
Sonnet XXXI,3,"As interest of the dead, which now appear/But things removed that hidden in thee lie!"
Sonnet XXXI,4,"Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,/Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
Sonnet XXXI,5,Who all their parts of me to thee did give;/That due of many now is thine alone:
Sonnet XXXI,6,"  Their images I loved I view in thee,/  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me."
Sonnet XXXII,0,"If thou survive my well-contented day,/When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,"
Sonnet XXXII,1,"And shalt by fortune once more re-survey/These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,"
Sonnet XXXII,2,"Compare them with the bettering of the time,/And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,"
Sonnet XXXII,3,"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,/Exceeded by the height of happier men."
Sonnet XXXII,4,"O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:/'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,"
Sonnet XXXII,5,"A dearer birth than this his love had brought,/To march in ranks of better equipage:"
Sonnet XXXII,6,"  But since he died and poets better prove,/  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'"
Sonnet XXXIII,0,"Full many a glorious morning have I seen/Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,"
Sonnet XXXIII,1,"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,/Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;"
Sonnet XXXIII,2,"Anon permit the basest clouds to ride/With ugly rack on his celestial face,"
Sonnet XXXIII,3,"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,/Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:"
Sonnet XXXIII,4,Even so my sun one early morn did shine/With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
Sonnet XXXIII,5,"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;/The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now."
Sonnet XXXIII,6,  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;/  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
Sonnet XXXIV,0,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,/And make me travel forth without my cloak,"
Sonnet XXXIV,1,"To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,/Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?"
Sonnet XXXIV,2,"'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,/To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,"
Sonnet XXXIV,3,For no man well of such a salve can speak/That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Sonnet XXXIV,4,"Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;/Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:"
Sonnet XXXIV,5,The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief/To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
Sonnet XXXIV,6,"  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,/  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds."
Sonnet XXXV,0,"No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:/Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;"
Sonnet XXXV,1,"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,/And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud."
Sonnet XXXV,2,"All men make faults, and even I in this,/Authorizing thy trespass with compare,"
Sonnet XXXV,3,"Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,/Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;"
Sonnet XXXV,4,For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--/Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
Sonnet XXXV,5,And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:/Such civil war is in my love and hate
Sonnet XXXV,6,  That I an accessary needs must be/  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
Sonnet XXXVI,0,"Let me confess that we two must be twain,/Although our undivided loves are one:"
Sonnet XXXVI,1,So shall those blots that do with me remain/Without thy help by me be borne alone.
Sonnet XXXVI,2,"In our two loves there is but one respect,/Though in our lives a separable spite,"
Sonnet XXXVI,3,"Which though it alter not love's sole effect,/Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight."
Sonnet XXXVI,4,"I may not evermore acknowledge thee,/Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,"
Sonnet XXXVI,5,"Nor thou with public kindness honour me,/Unless thou take that honour from thy name:"
Sonnet XXXVI,6,"  But do not so; I love thee in such sort/  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
Sonnet XXXVII,0,"As a decrepit father takes delight/To see his active child do deeds of youth,"
Sonnet XXXVII,1,"So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,/Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth."
Sonnet XXXVII,2,"For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,/Or any of these all, or all, or more,"
Sonnet XXXVII,3,"Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,/I make my love engrafted to this store:"
Sonnet XXXVII,4,"So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,/Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give"
Sonnet XXXVII,5,That I in thy abundance am sufficed/And by a part of all thy glory live.
Sonnet XXXVII,6,"  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:/  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!"
Sonnet XXXVIII,0,"How can my Muse want subject to invent,/While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse"
Sonnet XXXVIII,1,"Thine own sweet argument, too excellent/For every vulgar paper to rehearse?"
Sonnet XXXVIII,2,"O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me/Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;"
Sonnet XXXVIII,3,"For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,/When thou thyself dost give invention light?"
Sonnet XXXVIII,4,"Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth/Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;"
Sonnet XXXVIII,5,"And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth/Eternal numbers to outlive long date."
Sonnet XXXVIII,6,"  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,/  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise."
Sonnet XXXIX,0,"O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,/When thou art all the better part of me?"
Sonnet XXXIX,1,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?/And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
Sonnet XXXIX,2,"Even for this let us divided live,/And our dear love lose name of single one,"
Sonnet XXXIX,3,That by this separation I may give/That due to thee which thou deservest alone.
Sonnet XXXIX,4,"O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,/Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave"
Sonnet XXXIX,5,"To entertain the time with thoughts of love,/Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,"
Sonnet XXXIX,6,"  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,/  By praising him here who doth hence remain!"
Sonnet XL,0,"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;/What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?"
Sonnet XL,1,"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;/All mine was thine before thou hadst this more."
Sonnet XL,2,"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,/I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;"
Sonnet XL,3,"But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest/By wilful taste of what thyself refusest."
Sonnet XL,4,"I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,/Although thou steal thee all my poverty;"
Sonnet XL,5,"And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief/To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury."
Sonnet XL,6,"  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,/  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes."
Sonnet XLI,0,"Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,/When I am sometime absent from thy heart,"
Sonnet XLI,1,"Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,/For still temptation follows where thou art."
Sonnet XLI,2,"Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,/Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;"
Sonnet XLI,3,"And when a woman woos, what woman's son/Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?"
Sonnet XLI,4,"Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,/And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,"
Sonnet XLI,5,"Who lead thee in their riot even there/Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,"
Sonnet XLI,6,"  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,/  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me."
Sonnet XLII,0,"That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,/And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;"
Sonnet XLII,1,"That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,/A loss in love that touches me more nearly."
Sonnet XLII,2,"Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:/Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;"
Sonnet XLII,3,"And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,/Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her."
Sonnet XLII,4,"If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,/And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;"
Sonnet XLII,5,"Both find each other, and I lose both twain,/And both for my sake lay on me this cross:"
Sonnet XLII,6,  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;/  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
Sonnet XLIII,0,"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,/For all the day they view things unrespected;"
Sonnet XLIII,1,"But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,/And darkly bright are bright in dark directed."
Sonnet XLIII,2,"Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,/How would thy shadow's form form happy show"
Sonnet XLIII,3,"To the clear day with thy much clearer light,/When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!"
Sonnet XLIII,4,"How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made/By looking on thee in the living day,"
Sonnet XLIII,5,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade/Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
Sonnet XLIII,6,"  All days are nights to see till I see thee,/  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me."
Sonnet XLIV,0,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,/Injurious distance should not stop my way;"
Sonnet XLIV,1,"For then despite of space I would be brought,/From limits far remote where thou dost stay."
Sonnet XLIV,2,No matter then although my foot did stand/Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
Sonnet XLIV,3,For nimble thought can jump both sea and land/As soon as think the place where he would be.
Sonnet XLIV,4,"But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,/To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,"
Sonnet XLIV,5,"But that so much of earth and water wrought/I must attend time's leisure with my moan,"
Sonnet XLIV,6,"  Receiving nought by elements so slow/  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe."
Sonnet XLV,0,"The other two, slight air and purging fire,/Are both with thee, wherever I abide;"
Sonnet XLV,1,"The first my thought, the other my desire,/These present-absent with swift motion slide."
Sonnet XLV,2,"For when these quicker elements are gone/In tender embassy of love to thee,"
Sonnet XLV,3,"My life, being made of four, with two alone/Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;"
Sonnet XLV,4,"Until life's composition be recured/By those swift messengers return'd from thee,"
Sonnet XLV,5,"Who even but now come back again, assured/Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:"
Sonnet XLV,6,"  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,/  I send them back again and straight grow sad."
Sonnet XLVI,0,Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war/How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
Sonnet XLVI,1,"Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,/My heart mine eye the freedom of that right."
Sonnet XLVI,2,My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--/A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
Sonnet XLVI,3,But the defendant doth that plea deny/And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
Sonnet XLVI,4,"To 'cide this title is impanneled/A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,"
Sonnet XLVI,5,And by their verdict is determined/The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
Sonnet XLVI,6,"  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,/  And my heart's right thy inward love of heart."
Sonnet XLVII,0,"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,/And each doth good turns now unto the other:"
Sonnet XLVII,1,"When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,/Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,"
Sonnet XLVII,2,With my love's picture then my eye doth feast/And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
Sonnet XLVII,3,Another time mine eye is my heart's guest/And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
Sonnet XLVII,4,"So, either by thy picture or my love,/Thyself away art resent still with me;"
Sonnet XLVII,5,"For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,/And I am still with them and they with thee;"
Sonnet XLVII,6,"  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight/  Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight."
Sonnet XLVIII,0,"How careful was I, when I took my way,/Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,"
Sonnet XLVIII,1,"That to my use it might unused stay/From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!"
Sonnet XLVIII,2,"But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,/Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,"
Sonnet XLVIII,3,"Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,/Art left the prey of every vulgar thief."
Sonnet XLVIII,4,"Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,/Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,"
Sonnet XLVIII,5,"Within the gentle closure of my breast,/From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;"
Sonnet XLVIII,6,"  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,/  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear."
Sonnet XLIX,0,"Against that time, if ever that time come,/When I shall see thee frown on my defects,"
Sonnet XLIX,1,"When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,/Call'd to that audit by advised respects;"
Sonnet XLIX,2,"Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass/And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,"
Sonnet XLIX,3,"When love, converted from the thing it was,/Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--"
Sonnet XLIX,4,"Against that time do I ensconce me here/Within the knowledge of mine own desert,"
Sonnet XLIX,5,"And this my hand against myself uprear,/To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:"
Sonnet XLIX,6,"  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,/  Since why to love I can allege no cause."
Sonnet L,0,"How heavy do I journey on the way,/When what I seek, my weary travel's end,"
Sonnet L,1,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say/'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
Sonnet L,2,"The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,/Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,"
Sonnet L,3,"As if by some instinct the wretch did know/His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:"
Sonnet L,4,The bloody spur cannot provoke him on/That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
Sonnet L,5,"Which heavily he answers with a groan,/More sharp to me than spurring to his side;"
Sonnet L,6,  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;/  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
Sonnet LI,0,Thus can my love excuse the slow offence/Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
Sonnet LI,1,"From where thou art why should I haste me thence?/Till I return, of posting is no need."
Sonnet LI,2,"O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,/When swift extremity can seem but slow?"
Sonnet LI,3,"Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;/In winged speed no motion shall I know:"
Sonnet LI,4,"Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;/Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,"
Sonnet LI,5,"Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;/But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;"
Sonnet LI,6,"  Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,/  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."
Sonnet LII,0,"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key/Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,"
Sonnet LII,1,"The which he will not every hour survey,/For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure."
Sonnet LII,2,"Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,/Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,"
Sonnet LII,3,"Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,/Or captain jewels in the carcanet."
Sonnet LII,4,"So is the time that keeps you as my chest,/Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,"
Sonnet LII,5,"To make some special instant special blest,/By new unfolding his imprison'd pride."
Sonnet LII,6,"  Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,/  Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope."
Sonnet LIII,0,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?"
Sonnet LIII,1,"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,/And you, but one, can every shadow lend."
Sonnet LIII,2,"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit/Is poorly imitated after you;"
Sonnet LIII,3,"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,/And you in Grecian tires are painted new:"
Sonnet LIII,4,"Speak of the spring and foison of the year;/The one doth shadow of your beauty show,"
Sonnet LIII,5,The other as your bounty doth appear;/And you in every blessed shape we know.
Sonnet LIII,6,"  In all external grace you have some part,/  But you like none, none you, for constant heart."
Sonnet LIV,0,"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem/By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!"
Sonnet LIV,1,"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem/For that sweet odour which doth in it live."
Sonnet LIV,2,"The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye/As the perfumed tincture of the roses,"
Sonnet LIV,3,Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly/When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
Sonnet LIV,4,"But, for their virtue only is their show,/They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,"
Sonnet LIV,5,Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;/Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
Sonnet LIV,6,"  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,/  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth."
Sonnet LV,0,"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments/Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;"
Sonnet LV,1,But you shall shine more bright in these contents/Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
Sonnet LV,2,"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,/And broils root out the work of masonry,"
Sonnet LV,3,Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn/The living record of your memory.
Sonnet LV,4,'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity/Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Sonnet LV,5,Even in the eyes of all posterity/That wear this world out to the ending doom.
Sonnet LV,6,"  So, till the judgment that yourself arise,/  You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes."
Sonnet LVI,0,"Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said/Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,"
Sonnet LVI,1,"Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,/To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:"
Sonnet LVI,2,"So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill/Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,"
Sonnet LVI,3,"To-morrow see again, and do not kill/The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness."
Sonnet LVI,4,"Let this sad interim like the ocean be/Which parts the shore, where two contracted new"
Sonnet LVI,5,"Come daily to the banks, that, when they see/Return of love, more blest may be the view;"
Sonnet LVI,6,"  Else call it winter, which being full of care/  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare."
Sonnet LVII,0,"Being your slave, what should I do but tend/Upon the hours and times of your desire?"
Sonnet LVII,1,"I have no precious time at all to spend,/Nor services to do, till you require."
Sonnet LVII,2,"Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour/Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,"
Sonnet LVII,3,Nor think the bitterness of absence sour/When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Sonnet LVII,4,"Nor dare I question with my jealous thought/Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,"
Sonnet LVII,5,"But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought/Save, where you are how happy you make those."
Sonnet LVII,6,"  So true a fool is love that in your will,/  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill."
Sonnet LVIII,0,"That god forbid that made me first your slave,/I should in thought control your times of pleasure,"
Sonnet LVIII,1,"Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,/Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!"
Sonnet LVIII,2,"O, let me suffer, being at your beck,/The imprison'd absence of your liberty;"
Sonnet LVIII,3,"And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,/Without accusing you of injury."
Sonnet LVIII,4,"Be where you list, your charter is so strong/That you yourself may privilege your time"
Sonnet LVIII,5,To what you will; to you it doth belong/Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
Sonnet LVIII,6,"  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;/  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well."
Sonnet LIX,0,"If there be nothing new, but that which is/Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,"
Sonnet LIX,1,"Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss/The second burden of a former child!"
Sonnet LIX,2,"O, that record could with a backward look,/Even of five hundred courses of the sun,"
Sonnet LIX,3,"Show me your image in some antique book,/Since mind at first in character was done!"
Sonnet LIX,4,That I might see what the old world could say/To this composed wonder of your frame;
Sonnet LIX,5,"Whether we are mended, or whether better they,/Or whether revolution be the same."
Sonnet LIX,6,"  O, sure I am, the wits of former days/  To subjects worse have given admiring praise."
Sonnet LX,0,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,/So do our minutes hasten to their end;"
Sonnet LX,1,"Each changing place with that which goes before,/In sequent toil all forwards do contend."
Sonnet LX,2,"Nativity, once in the main of light,/Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,"
Sonnet LX,3,"Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,/And Time that gave doth now his gift confound."
Sonnet LX,4,"Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth/And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,"
Sonnet LX,5,"Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,/And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:"
Sonnet LX,6,"  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,/  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand."
Sonnet LXI,0,Is it thy will thy image should keep open/My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
Sonnet LXI,1,"Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,/While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?"
Sonnet LXI,2,"Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee/So far from home into my deeds to pry,"
Sonnet LXI,3,"To find out shames and idle hours in me,/The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?"
Sonnet LXI,4,"O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:/It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;"
Sonnet LXI,5,"Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,/To play the watchman ever for thy sake:"
Sonnet LXI,6,"  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,/  From me far off, with others all too near."
Sonnet LXII,0,Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye/And all my soul and all my every part;
Sonnet LXII,1,"And for this sin there is no remedy,/It is so grounded inward in my heart."
Sonnet LXII,2,"Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,/No shape so true, no truth of such account;"
Sonnet LXII,3,"And for myself mine own worth do define,/As I all other in all worths surmount."
Sonnet LXII,4,"But when my glass shows me myself indeed,/Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,"
Sonnet LXII,5,Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;/Self so self-loving were iniquity.
Sonnet LXII,6,"  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,/  Painting my age with beauty of thy days."
Sonnet LXIII,0,"Against my love shall be, as I am now,/With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;"
Sonnet LXIII,1,When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow/With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
Sonnet LXIII,2,"Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,/And all those beauties whereof now he's king"
Sonnet LXIII,3,"Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,/Stealing away the treasure of his spring;"
Sonnet LXIII,4,"For such a time do I now fortify/Against confounding age's cruel knife,"
Sonnet LXIII,5,"That he shall never cut from memory/My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:"
Sonnet LXIII,6,"  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,/  And they shall live, and he in them still green."
Sonnet LXIV,0,When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced/The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
Sonnet LXIV,1,When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed/And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
Sonnet LXIV,2,"When I have seen the hungry ocean gain/Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
Sonnet LXIV,3,"And the firm soil win of the watery main,/Increasing store with loss and loss with store;"
Sonnet LXIV,4,"When I have seen such interchange of state,/Or state itself confounded to decay;"
Sonnet LXIV,5,"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,/That Time will come and take my love away."
Sonnet LXIV,6,"  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose/  But weep to have that which it fears to lose."
Sonnet LXV,0,"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,/But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,"
Sonnet LXV,1,"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,/Whose action is no stronger than a flower?"
Sonnet LXV,2,"O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out/Against the wreckful siege of battering days,"
Sonnet LXV,3,"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,/Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?"
Sonnet LXV,4,"O fearful meditation! where, alack,/Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?"
Sonnet LXV,5,Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?/Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
Sonnet LXV,6,"  O, none, unless this miracle have might,/  That in black ink my love may still shine bright."
Sonnet LXVI,0,"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,/As, to behold desert a beggar born,"
Sonnet LXVI,1,"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,/And purest faith unhappily forsworn,"
Sonnet LXVI,2,"And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,/And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,"
Sonnet LXVI,3,"And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,/And strength by limping sway disabled,"
Sonnet LXVI,4,"And art made tongue-tied by authority,/And folly doctor-like controlling skill,"
Sonnet LXVI,5,"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,/And captive good attending captain ill:"
Sonnet LXVI,6,"  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,/  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone."
Sonnet LXVII,0,"Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,/And with his presence grace impiety,"
Sonnet LXVII,1,That sin by him advantage should achieve/And lace itself with his society?
Sonnet LXVII,2,Why should false painting imitate his cheek/And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
Sonnet LXVII,3,"Why should poor beauty indirectly seek/Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?"
Sonnet LXVII,4,"Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,/Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?"
Sonnet LXVII,5,"For she hath no exchequer now but his,/And, proud of many, lives upon his gains."
Sonnet LXVII,6,"  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had/  In days long since, before these last so bad."
Sonnet LXVIII,0,"Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,/When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,"
Sonnet LXVIII,1,"Before the bastard signs of fair were born,/Or durst inhabit on a living brow;"
Sonnet LXVIII,2,"Before the golden tresses of the dead,/The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,"
Sonnet LXVIII,3,To live a second life on second head;/Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
Sonnet LXVIII,4,"In him those holy antique hours are seen,/Without all ornament, itself and true,"
Sonnet LXVIII,5,"Making no summer of another's green,/Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;"
Sonnet LXVIII,6,"  And him as for a map doth Nature store,/  To show false Art what beauty was of yore."
Sonnet LXIX,0,Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view/Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
Sonnet LXIX,1,"All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,/Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend."
Sonnet LXIX,2,Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;/But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
Sonnet LXIX,3,In other accents do this praise confound/By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
Sonnet LXIX,4,"They look into the beauty of thy mind,/And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;"
Sonnet LXIX,5,"Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,/To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:"
Sonnet LXIX,6,"  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,/  The solve is this, that thou dost common grow."
Sonnet LXX,0,"That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,/For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;"
Sonnet LXX,1,"The ornament of beauty is suspect,/A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air."
Sonnet LXX,2,"So thou be good, slander doth but approve/Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;"
Sonnet LXX,3,"For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,/And thou present'st a pure unstained prime."
Sonnet LXX,4,"Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,/Either not assail'd or victor being charged;"
Sonnet LXX,5,"Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,/To tie up envy evermore enlarged:"
Sonnet LXX,6,"  If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,/  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe."
Sonnet LXXI,0,No longer mourn for me when I am dead/Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Sonnet LXXI,1,"Give warning to the world that I am fled/From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:"
Sonnet LXXI,2,"Nay, if you read this line, remember not/The hand that writ it; for I love you so"
Sonnet LXXI,3,That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot/If thinking on me then should make you woe.
Sonnet LXXI,4,"O, if, I say, you look upon this verse/When I perhaps compounded am with clay,"
Sonnet LXXI,5,"Do not so much as my poor name rehearse./But let your love even with my life decay,"
Sonnet LXXI,6,  Lest the wise world should look into your moan/  And mock you with me after I am gone.
Sonnet LXXII,0,"O, lest the world should task you to recite/What merit lived in me, that you should love"
Sonnet LXXII,1,"After my death, dear love, forget me quite,/For you in me can nothing worthy prove;"
Sonnet LXXII,2,"Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,/To do more for me than mine own desert,"
Sonnet LXXII,3,And hang more praise upon deceased I/Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
Sonnet LXXII,4,"O, lest your true love may seem false in this,/That you for love speak well of me untrue,"
Sonnet LXXII,5,"My name be buried where my body is,/And live no more to shame nor me nor you."
Sonnet LXXII,6,"  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,/  And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
Sonnet LXXIII,0,"That time of year thou mayst in me behold/When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang"
Sonnet LXXIII,1,"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,/Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."
Sonnet LXXIII,2,"In me thou seest the twilight of such day/As after sunset fadeth in the west,"
Sonnet LXXIII,3,"Which by and by black night doth take away,/Death's second self, that seals up all in rest."
Sonnet LXXIII,4,"In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire/That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
Sonnet LXXIII,5,As the death-bed whereon it must expire/Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
Sonnet LXXIII,6,"  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,/  To love that well which thou must leave ere long."
Sonnet LXXIV,0,"But be contented: when that fell arrest/Without all bail shall carry me away,"
Sonnet LXXIV,1,"My life hath in this line some interest,/Which for memorial still with thee shall stay."
Sonnet LXXIV,2,"When thou reviewest this, thou dost review/The very part was consecrate to thee:"
Sonnet LXXIV,3,"The earth can have but earth, which is his due;/My spirit is thine, the better part of me:"
Sonnet LXXIV,4,"So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,/The prey of worms, my body being dead,"
Sonnet LXXIV,5,"The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,/Too base of thee to be remembered."
Sonnet LXXIV,6,"  The worth of that is that which it contains,/  And that is this, and this with thee remains."
Sonnet LXXV,0,"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,/Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;"
Sonnet LXXV,1,And for the peace of you I hold such strife/As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
Sonnet LXXV,2,"Now proud as an enjoyer and anon/Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,"
Sonnet LXXV,3,"Now counting best to be with you alone,/Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;"
Sonnet LXXV,4,Sometime all full with feasting on your sight/And by and by clean starved for a look;
Sonnet LXXV,5,"Possessing or pursuing no delight,/Save what is had or must from you be took."
Sonnet LXXV,6,"  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,/  Or gluttoning on all, or all away."
Sonnet LXXVI,0,"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,/So far from variation or quick change?"
Sonnet LXXVI,1,Why with the time do I not glance aside/To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
Sonnet LXXVI,2,"Why write I still all one, ever the same,/And keep invention in a noted weed,"
Sonnet LXXVI,3,"That every word doth almost tell my name,/Showing their birth and where they did proceed?"
Sonnet LXXVI,4,"O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,/And you and love are still my argument;"
Sonnet LXXVI,5,"So all my best is dressing old words new,/Spending again what is already spent:"
Sonnet LXXVI,6,"  For as the sun is daily new and old,/  So is my love still telling what is told."
Sonnet LXXVII,0,"Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,/Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;"
Sonnet LXXVII,1,"The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,/And of this book this learning mayst thou taste."
Sonnet LXXVII,2,The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show/Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Sonnet LXXVII,3,Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know/Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Sonnet LXXVII,4,"Look, what thy memory can not contain/Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find"
Sonnet LXXVII,5,"Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,/To take a new acquaintance of thy mind."
Sonnet LXXVII,6,"  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,/  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book."
Sonnet LXXVIII,0,So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse/And found such fair assistance in my verse
Sonnet LXXVIII,1,As every alien pen hath got my use/And under thee their poesy disperse.
Sonnet LXXVIII,2,Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing/And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Sonnet LXXVIII,3,Have added feathers to the learned's wing/And given grace a double majesty.
Sonnet LXXVIII,4,"Yet be most proud of that which I compile,/Whose influence is thine and born of thee:"
Sonnet LXXVIII,5,"In others' works thou dost but mend the style,/And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;"
Sonnet LXXVIII,6,  But thou art all my art and dost advance/  As high as learning my rude ignorance.
Sonnet LXXIX,0,"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,/My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,"
Sonnet LXXIX,1,But now my gracious numbers are decay'd/And my sick Muse doth give another place.
Sonnet LXXIX,2,"I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument/Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,"
Sonnet LXXIX,3,Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent/He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
Sonnet LXXIX,4,He lends thee virtue and he stole that word/From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
Sonnet LXXIX,5,And found it in thy cheek; he can afford/No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
Sonnet LXXIX,6,"  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,/  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay."
Sonnet LXXX,0,"O, how I faint when I of you do write,/Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,"
Sonnet LXXX,1,"And in the praise thereof spends all his might,/To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!"
Sonnet LXXX,2,"But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,/The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,"
Sonnet LXXX,3,My saucy bark inferior far to his/On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
Sonnet LXXX,4,"Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,/Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;"
Sonnet LXXX,5,"Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,/He of tall building and of goodly pride:"
Sonnet LXXX,6,"  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,/  The worst was this; my love was my decay."
Sonnet LXXXI,0,"Or I shall live your epitaph to make,/Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;"
Sonnet LXXXI,1,"From hence your memory death cannot take,/Although in me each part will be forgotten."
Sonnet LXXXI,2,"Your name from hence immortal life shall have,/Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:"
Sonnet LXXXI,3,"The earth can yield me but a common grave,/When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie."
Sonnet LXXXI,4,"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,/Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,"
Sonnet LXXXI,5,And tongues to be your being shall rehearse/When all the breathers of this world are dead;
Sonnet LXXXI,6,"  You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--/  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men."
Sonnet LXXXII,0,I grant thou wert not married to my Muse/And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
Sonnet LXXXII,1,"The dedicated words which writers use/Of their fair subject, blessing every book"
Sonnet LXXXII,2,"Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,/Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,"
Sonnet LXXXII,3,And therefore art enforced to seek anew/Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
Sonnet LXXXII,4,"And do so, love; yet when they have devised/What strained touches rhetoric can lend,"
Sonnet LXXXII,5,Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized/In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
Sonnet LXXXII,6,  And their gross painting might be better used/  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
Sonnet LXXXIII,0,I never saw that you did painting need/And therefore to your fair no painting set;
Sonnet LXXXIII,1,"I found, or thought I found, you did exceed/The barren tender of a poet's debt;"
Sonnet LXXXIII,2,"And therefore have I slept in your report,/That you yourself being extant well might show"
Sonnet LXXXIII,3,"How far a modern quill doth come too short,/Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow."
Sonnet LXXXIII,4,"This silence for my sin you did impute,/Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;"
Sonnet LXXXIII,5,"For I impair not beauty being mute,/When others would give life and bring a tomb."
Sonnet LXXXIII,6,  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes/  Than both your poets can in praise devise.
Sonnet LXXXIV,0,"Who is it that says most? which can say more/Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?"
Sonnet LXXXIV,1,In whose confine immured is the store/Which should example where your equal grew.
Sonnet LXXXIV,2,Lean penury within that pen doth dwell/That to his subject lends not some small glory;
Sonnet LXXXIV,3,"But he that writes of you, if he can tell/That you are you, so dignifies his story,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,4,"Let him but copy what in you is writ,/Not making worse what nature made so clear,"
Sonnet LXXXIV,5,"And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,/Making his style admired every where."
Sonnet LXXXIV,6,"  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,/  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse."
Sonnet LXXXV,0,"My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,/While comments of your praise, richly compiled,"
Sonnet LXXXV,1,Reserve their character with golden quill/And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
Sonnet LXXXV,2,"I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,/And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'"
Sonnet LXXXV,3,To every hymn that able spirit affords/In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
Sonnet LXXXV,4,"Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'/And to the most of praise add something more;"
Sonnet LXXXV,5,"But that is in my thought, whose love to you,/Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before."
Sonnet LXXXV,6,"  Then others for the breath of words respect,/  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect."
Sonnet LXXXVI,0,"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,/Bound for the prize of all too precious you,"
Sonnet LXXXVI,1,"That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,/Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?"
Sonnet LXXXVI,2,"Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write/Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?"
Sonnet LXXXVI,3,"No, neither he, nor his compeers by night/Giving him aid, my verse astonished."
Sonnet LXXXVI,4,"He, nor that affable familiar ghost/Which nightly gulls him with intelligence"
Sonnet LXXXVI,5,As victors of my silence cannot boast;/I was not sick of any fear from thence:
Sonnet LXXXVI,6,"  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,/  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine."
Sonnet LXXXVII,0,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,/And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:"
Sonnet LXXXVII,1,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;/My bonds in thee are all determinate.
Sonnet LXXXVII,2,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?/And for that riches where is my deserving?
Sonnet LXXXVII,3,"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,/And so my patent back again is swerving."
Sonnet LXXXVII,4,"Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,/Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;"
Sonnet LXXXVII,5,"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,/Comes home again, on better judgment making."
Sonnet LXXXVII,6,"  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,/  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,0,"When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,/And place my merit in the eye of scorn,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,1,"Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,/And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,2,"With mine own weakness being best acquainted,/Upon thy part I can set down a story"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,3,"Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,/That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,4,"And I by this will be a gainer too;/For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,"
Sonnet LXXXVIII,5,"The injuries that to myself I do,/Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me."
Sonnet LXXXVIII,6,"  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,/  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong."
Sonnet LXXXIX,0,"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,/And I will comment upon that offence;"
Sonnet LXXXIX,1,"Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,/Against thy reasons making no defence."
Sonnet LXXXIX,2,"Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,/To set a form upon desired change,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,3,"As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,/I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,4,"Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue/Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,"
Sonnet LXXXIX,5,"Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong/And haply of our old acquaintance tell."
Sonnet LXXXIX,6,"  For thee against myself I'll vow debate,/  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate."
Sonnet XC,0,"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;/Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,"
Sonnet XC,1,"Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,/And do not drop in for an after-loss:"
Sonnet XC,2,"Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,/Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;"
Sonnet XC,3,"Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,/To linger out a purposed overthrow."
Sonnet XC,4,"If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,/When other petty griefs have done their spite"
Sonnet XC,5,"But in the onset come; so shall I taste/At first the very worst of fortune's might,"
Sonnet XC,6,"  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,/  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so."
Sonnet XCI,0,"Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,/Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,"
Sonnet XCI,1,"Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,/Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;"
Sonnet XCI,2,"And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,/Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:"
Sonnet XCI,3,But these particulars are not my measure;/All these I better in one general best.
Sonnet XCI,4,"Thy love is better than high birth to me,/Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,"
Sonnet XCI,5,"Of more delight than hawks or horses be;/And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:"
Sonnet XCI,6,"  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take/  All this away and me most wretched make."
Sonnet XCII,0,"But do thy worst to steal thyself away,/For term of life thou art assured mine,"
Sonnet XCII,1,"And life no longer than thy love will stay,/For it depends upon that love of thine."
Sonnet XCII,2,"Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,/When in the least of them my life hath end."
Sonnet XCII,3,I see a better state to me belongs/Than that which on thy humour doth depend;
Sonnet XCII,4,"Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,/Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie."
Sonnet XCII,5,"O, what a happy title do I find,/Happy to have thy love, happy to die!"
Sonnet XCII,6,"  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?/  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not."
Sonnet XCIII,0,"So shall I live, supposing thou art true,/Like a deceived husband; so love's face"
Sonnet XCIII,1,"May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;/Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:"
Sonnet XCIII,2,"For there can live no hatred in thine eye,/Therefore in that I cannot know thy change."
Sonnet XCIII,3,"In many's looks the false heart's history/Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,"
Sonnet XCIII,4,But heaven in thy creation did decree/That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Sonnet XCIII,5,"Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,/Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell."
Sonnet XCIII,6,"  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,/  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!"
Sonnet XCIV,0,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,/That do not do the thing they most do show,"
Sonnet XCIV,1,"Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,/Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
Sonnet XCIV,2,They rightly do inherit heaven's graces/And husband nature's riches from expense;
Sonnet XCIV,3,"They are the lords and owners of their faces,/Others but stewards of their excellence."
Sonnet XCIV,4,"The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,/Though to itself it only live and die,"
Sonnet XCIV,5,"But if that flower with base infection meet,/The basest weed outbraves his dignity:"
Sonnet XCIV,6,  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;/  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
Sonnet XCV,0,"How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame/Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,"
Sonnet XCV,1,"Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!/O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!"
Sonnet XCV,2,"That tongue that tells the story of thy days,/Making lascivious comments on thy sport,"
Sonnet XCV,3,Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;/Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
Sonnet XCV,4,"O, what a mansion have those vices got/Which for their habitation chose out thee,"
Sonnet XCV,5,"Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,/And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!"
Sonnet XCV,6,"  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;/  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge."
Sonnet XCVI,0,"Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;/Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;"
Sonnet XCVI,1,Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;/Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
Sonnet XCVI,2,"As on the finger of a throned queen/The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,"
Sonnet XCVI,3,So are those errors that in thee are seen/To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
Sonnet XCVI,4,"How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,/If like a lamb he could his looks translate!"
Sonnet XCVI,5,"How many gazers mightst thou lead away,/If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!"
Sonnet XCVI,6,"  But do not so; I love thee in such sort/  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
Sonnet XCVII,0,"How like a winter hath my absence been/From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!"
Sonnet XCVII,1,"What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!/What old December's bareness every where!"
Sonnet XCVII,2,"And yet this time removed was summer's time,/The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,"
Sonnet XCVII,3,"Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,/Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:"
Sonnet XCVII,4,Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me/But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
Sonnet XCVII,5,"For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,/And, thou away, the very birds are mute;"
Sonnet XCVII,6,"  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer/  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
Sonnet XCVIII,0,"From you have I been absent in the spring,/When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim"
Sonnet XCVIII,1,"Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,/That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him."
Sonnet XCVIII,2,Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell/Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Sonnet XCVIII,3,"Could make me any summer's story tell,/Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;"
Sonnet XCVIII,4,"Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,/Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;"
Sonnet XCVIII,5,"They were but sweet, but figures of delight,/Drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
Sonnet XCVIII,6,"  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,/  As with your shadow I with these did play:"
Sonnet XCIX,0,"The forward violet thus did I chide:/Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,"
Sonnet XCIX,1,If not from my love's breath? The purple pride/Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
Sonnet XCIX,2,"In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed./The lily I condemned for thy hand,"
Sonnet XCIX,3,"And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:/The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,"
Sonnet XCIX,4,"One blushing shame, another white despair;/A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both"
Sonnet XCIX,5,"And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;/But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth"
Sonnet XCIX,6,"A vengeful canker eat him up to death./  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see"
Sonnet XCIX,7,  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee./
Sonnet C,0,"Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long/To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?"
Sonnet C,1,"Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,/Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?"
Sonnet C,2,"Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem/In gentle numbers time so idly spent;"
Sonnet C,3,Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem/And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
Sonnet C,4,"Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,/If Time have any wrinkle graven there;"
Sonnet C,5,"If any, be a satire to decay,/And make Time's spoils despised every where."
Sonnet C,6,  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;/  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
Sonnet CI,0,"O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends/For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?"
Sonnet CI,1,"Both truth and beauty on my love depends;/So dost thou too, and therein dignified."
Sonnet CI,2,"Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say/'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;"
Sonnet CI,3,"Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;/But best is best, if never intermix'd?'"
Sonnet CI,4,"Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?/Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee"
Sonnet CI,5,"To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,/And to be praised of ages yet to be."
Sonnet CI,6,"  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how/  To make him seem long hence as he shows now."
Sonnet CII,0,"My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;/I love not less, though less the show appear:"
Sonnet CII,1,That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming/The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
Sonnet CII,2,"Our love was new and then but in the spring/When I was wont to greet it with my lays,"
Sonnet CII,3,As Philomel in summer's front doth sing/And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
Sonnet CII,4,"Not that the summer is less pleasant now/Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,"
Sonnet CII,5,But that wild music burthens every bough/And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
Sonnet CII,6,"  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,/  Because I would not dull you with my song."
Sonnet CIII,0,"Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,/That having such a scope to show her pride,"
Sonnet CIII,1,The argument all bare is of more worth/Than when it hath my added praise beside!
Sonnet CIII,2,"O, blame me not, if I no more can write!/Look in your glass, and there appears a face"
Sonnet CIII,3,"That over-goes my blunt invention quite,/Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace."
Sonnet CIII,4,"Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,/To mar the subject that before was well?"
Sonnet CIII,5,For to no other pass my verses tend/Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
Sonnet CIII,6,"  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit/  Your own glass shows you when you look in it."
Sonnet CIV,0,"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,/For as you were when first your eye I eyed,"
Sonnet CIV,1,"Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold/Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,"
Sonnet CIV,2,"Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd/In process of the seasons have I seen,"
Sonnet CIV,3,"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,/Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green."
Sonnet CIV,4,"Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,/Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;"
Sonnet CIV,5,"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,/Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:"
Sonnet CIV,6,"  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;/  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead."
Sonnet CV,0,"Let not my love be call'd idolatry,/Nor my beloved as an idol show,"
Sonnet CV,1,"Since all alike my songs and praises be/To one, of one, still such, and ever so."
Sonnet CV,2,"Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,/Still constant in a wondrous excellence;"
Sonnet CV,3,"Therefore my verse to constancy confined,/One thing expressing, leaves out difference."
Sonnet CV,4,"'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,/'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;"
Sonnet CV,5,"And in this change is my invention spent,/Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords."
Sonnet CV,6,"  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,/  Which three till now never kept seat in one."
Sonnet CVI,0,"When in the chronicle of wasted time/I see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
Sonnet CVI,1,"And beauty making beautiful old rhyme/In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,"
Sonnet CVI,2,"Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,/Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
Sonnet CVI,3,I see their antique pen would have express'd/Even such a beauty as you master now.
Sonnet CVI,4,"So all their praises are but prophecies/Of this our time, all you prefiguring;"
Sonnet CVI,5,"And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,/They had not skill enough your worth to sing:"
Sonnet CVI,6,"  For we, which now behold these present days,/  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."
Sonnet CVII,0,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul/Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
Sonnet CVII,1,"Can yet the lease of my true love control,/Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom."
Sonnet CVII,2,The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured/And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Sonnet CVII,3,Incertainties now crown themselves assured/And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Sonnet CVII,4,"Now with the drops of this most balmy time/My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
Sonnet CVII,5,"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,/While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:"
Sonnet CVII,6,"  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,/  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent."
Sonnet CVIII,0,What's in the brain that ink may character/Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
Sonnet CVIII,1,"What's new to speak, what new to register,/That may express my love or thy dear merit?"
Sonnet CVIII,2,"Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,/I must, each day say o'er the very same,"
Sonnet CVIII,3,"Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,/Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name."
Sonnet CVIII,4,"So that eternal love in love's fresh case/Weighs not the dust and injury of age,"
Sonnet CVIII,5,"Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,/But makes antiquity for aye his page,"
Sonnet CVIII,6,  Finding the first conceit of love there bred/  Where time and outward form would show it dead.
Sonnet CIX,0,"O, never say that I was false of heart,/Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify."
Sonnet CIX,1,"As easy might I from myself depart/As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:"
Sonnet CIX,2,"That is my home of love: if I have ranged,/Like him that travels I return again,"
Sonnet CIX,3,"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,/So that myself bring water for my stain."
Sonnet CIX,4,"Never believe, though in my nature reign'd/All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,"
Sonnet CIX,5,"That it could so preposterously be stain'd,/To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;"
Sonnet CIX,6,"  For nothing this wide universe I call,/  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all."
Sonnet CX,0,"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there/And made myself a motley to the view,"
Sonnet CX,1,"Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,/Made old offences of affections new;"
Sonnet CX,2,"Most true it is that I have look'd on truth/Askance and strangely: but, by all above,"
Sonnet CX,3,"These blenches gave my heart another youth,/And worse essays proved thee my best of love."
Sonnet CX,4,"Now all is done, have what shall have no end:/Mine appetite I never more will grind"
Sonnet CX,5,"On newer proof, to try an older friend,/A god in love, to whom I am confined."
Sonnet CX,6,"  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,/  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast."
Sonnet CXI,0,"O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,/The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
Sonnet CXI,1,That did not better for my life provide/Than public means which public manners breeds.
Sonnet CXI,2,"Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,/And almost thence my nature is subdued"
Sonnet CXI,3,"To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:/Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;"
Sonnet CXI,4,"Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink/Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection"
Sonnet CXI,5,"No bitterness that I will bitter think,/Nor double penance, to correct correction."
Sonnet CXI,6,"  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye/  Even that your pity is enough to cure me."
Sonnet CXII,0,Your love and pity doth the impression fill/Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
Sonnet CXII,1,"For what care I who calls me well or ill,/So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?"
Sonnet CXII,2,"You are my all the world, and I must strive/To know my shames and praises from your tongue:"
Sonnet CXII,3,"None else to me, nor I to none alive,/That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong."
Sonnet CXII,4,"In so profound abysm I throw all care/Of others' voices, that my adder's sense"
Sonnet CXII,5,To critic and to flatterer stopped are./Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
Sonnet CXII,6,  You are so strongly in my purpose bred/  That all the world besides methinks are dead.
Sonnet CXIII,0,"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;/And that which governs me to go about"
Sonnet CXIII,1,"Doth part his function and is partly blind,/Seems seeing, but effectually is out;"
Sonnet CXIII,2,"For it no form delivers to the heart/Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:"
Sonnet CXIII,3,"Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,/Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:"
Sonnet CXIII,4,"For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,/The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,"
Sonnet CXIII,5,"The mountain or the sea, the day or night,/The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:"
Sonnet CXIII,6,"  Incapable of more, replete with you,/  My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue."
Sonnet CXIV,0,"Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,/Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?"
Sonnet CXIV,1,"Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,/And that your love taught it this alchemy,"
Sonnet CXIV,2,"To make of monsters and things indigest/Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,"
Sonnet CXIV,3,"Creating every bad a perfect best,/As fast as objects to his beams assemble?"
Sonnet CXIV,4,"O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,/And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:"
Sonnet CXIV,5,"Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,/And to his palate doth prepare the cup:"
Sonnet CXIV,6,"  If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin/  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin."
Sonnet CXV,0,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,/Even those that said I could not love you dearer:"
Sonnet CXV,1,Yet then my judgment knew no reason why/My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
Sonnet CXV,2,"But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents/Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,"
Sonnet CXV,3,"Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,/Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;"
Sonnet CXV,4,"Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,/Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'"
Sonnet CXV,5,"When I was certain o'er incertainty,/Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?"
Sonnet CXV,6,"  Love is a babe; then might I not say so,/  To give full growth to that which still doth grow?"
Sonnet CXVI,0,Let me not to the marriage of true minds/Admit impediments. Love is not love
Sonnet CXVI,1,"Which alters when it alteration finds,/Or bends with the remover to remove:"
Sonnet CXVI,2,O no! it is an ever-fixed mark/That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
Sonnet CXVI,3,"It is the star to every wandering bark,/Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Sonnet CXVI,4,"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks/Within his bending sickle's compass come:"
Sonnet CXVI,5,"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,/But bears it out even to the edge of doom."
Sonnet CXVI,6,"  If this be error and upon me proved,/  I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
Sonnet CXVII,0,"Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all/Wherein I should your great deserts repay,"
Sonnet CXVII,1,"Forgot upon your dearest love to call,/Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;"
Sonnet CXVII,2,That I have frequent been with unknown minds/And given to time your own dear-purchased right
Sonnet CXVII,3,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds/Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
Sonnet CXVII,4,Book both my wilfulness and errors down/And on just proof surmise accumulate;
Sonnet CXVII,5,"Bring me within the level of your frown,/But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;"
Sonnet CXVII,6,  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove/  The constancy and virtue of your love.
Sonnet CXVIII,0,"Like as, to make our appetites more keen,/With eager compounds we our palate urge,"
Sonnet CXVIII,1,"As, to prevent our maladies unseen,/We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,"
Sonnet CXVIII,2,"Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,/To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding"
Sonnet CXVIII,3,"And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness/To be diseased ere that there was true needing."
Sonnet CXVIII,4,"Thus policy in love, to anticipate/The ills that were not, grew to faults assured"
Sonnet CXVIII,5,"And brought to medicine a healthful state/Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:"
Sonnet CXVIII,6,"  But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,/  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you."
Sonnet CXIX,0,"What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,/Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,"
Sonnet CXIX,1,"Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,/Still losing when I saw myself to win!"
Sonnet CXIX,2,"What wretched errors hath my heart committed,/Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!"
Sonnet CXIX,3,How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted/In the distraction of this madding fever!
Sonnet CXIX,4,O benefit of ill! now I find true/That better is by evil still made better;
Sonnet CXIX,5,"And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,/Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater."
Sonnet CXIX,6,  So I return rebuked to my content/  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
Sonnet CXX,0,"That you were once unkind befriends me now,/And for that sorrow which I then did feel"
Sonnet CXX,1,"Needs must I under my transgression bow,/Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel."
Sonnet CXX,2,"For if you were by my unkindness shaken/As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,"
Sonnet CXX,3,"And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken/To weigh how once I suffered in your crime."
Sonnet CXX,4,"O, that our night of woe might have remember'd/My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,"
Sonnet CXX,5,"And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd/The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!"
Sonnet CXX,6,"  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;/  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me."
Sonnet CXXI,0,"'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,/When not to be receives reproach of being,"
Sonnet CXXI,1,And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd/Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
Sonnet CXXI,2,For why should others false adulterate eyes/Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Sonnet CXXI,3,"Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,/Which in their wills count bad what I think good?"
Sonnet CXXI,4,"No, I am that I am, and they that level/At my abuses reckon up their own:"
Sonnet CXXI,5,"I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;/By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;"
Sonnet CXXI,6,"  Unless this general evil they maintain,/  All men are bad, and in their badness reign."
Sonnet CXXII,0,"Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain/Full character'd with lasting memory,"
Sonnet CXXII,1,"Which shall above that idle rank remain/Beyond all date, even to eternity;"
Sonnet CXXII,2,"Or at the least, so long as brain and heart/Have faculty by nature to subsist;"
Sonnet CXXII,3,"Till each to razed oblivion yield his part/Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd."
Sonnet CXXII,4,"That poor retention could not so much hold,/Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;"
Sonnet CXXII,5,"Therefore to give them from me was I bold,/To trust those tables that receive thee more:"
Sonnet CXXII,6,  To keep an adjunct to remember thee/  Were to import forgetfulness in me.
Sonnet CXXIII,0,"No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:/Thy pyramids built up with newer might"
Sonnet CXXIII,1,"To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;/They are but dressings of a former sight."
Sonnet CXXIII,2,"Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire/What thou dost foist upon us that is old,"
Sonnet CXXIII,3,And rather make them born to our desire/Than think that we before have heard them told.
Sonnet CXXIII,4,"Thy registers and thee I both defy,/Not wondering at the present nor the past,"
Sonnet CXXIII,5,"For thy records and what we see doth lie,/Made more or less by thy continual haste."
Sonnet CXXIII,6,"  This I do vow and this shall ever be;/  I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee."
Sonnet CXXIV,0,"If my dear love were but the child of state,/It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'"
Sonnet CXXIV,1,"As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,/Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd."
Sonnet CXXIV,2,"No, it was builded far from accident;/It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls"
Sonnet CXXIV,3,"Under the blow of thralled discontent,/Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:"
Sonnet CXXIV,4,"It fears not policy, that heretic,/Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,"
Sonnet CXXIV,5,"But all alone stands hugely politic,/That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers."
Sonnet CXXIV,6,"  To this I witness call the fools of time,/  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime."
Sonnet CXXV,0,"Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,/With my extern the outward honouring,"
Sonnet CXXV,1,"Or laid great bases for eternity,/Which prove more short than waste or ruining?"
Sonnet CXXV,2,"Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour/Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,"
Sonnet CXXV,3,"For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,/Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?"
Sonnet CXXV,4,"No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,/And take thou my oblation, poor but free,"
Sonnet CXXV,5,"Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,/But mutual render, only me for thee."
Sonnet CXXV,6,"  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul/  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control."
Sonnet CXXVI,0,"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power/Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;"
Sonnet CXXVI,1,"Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st/Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;"
Sonnet CXXVI,2,"If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,/As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,"
Sonnet CXXVI,3,"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill/May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill."
Sonnet CXXVI,4,"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!/She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:"
Sonnet CXXVI,5,"  Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,/  And her quietus is to render thee."
Sonnet CXXVII,0,"In the old age black was not counted fair,/Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;"
Sonnet CXXVII,1,"But now is black beauty's successive heir,/And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:"
Sonnet CXXVII,2,"For since each hand hath put on nature's power,/Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,"
Sonnet CXXVII,3,"Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,/But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace."
Sonnet CXXVII,4,"Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,/Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem"
Sonnet CXXVII,5,"At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,/Slandering creation with a false esteem:"
Sonnet CXXVII,6,"  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,/  That every tongue says beauty should look so."
Sonnet CXXVIII,0,"How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,/Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds"
Sonnet CXXVIII,1,"With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st/The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,2,"Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap/To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,3,"Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,/At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!"
Sonnet CXXVIII,4,"To be so tickled, they would change their state/And situation with those dancing chips,"
Sonnet CXXVIII,5,"O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,/Making dead wood more blest than living lips."
Sonnet CXXVIII,6,"  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,/  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
Sonnet CXXIX,0,"The expense of spirit in a waste of shame/Is lust in action; and till action, lust"
Sonnet CXXIX,1,"Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,/Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,"
Sonnet CXXIX,2,"Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,/Past reason hunted, and no sooner had"
Sonnet CXXIX,3,"Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait/On purpose laid to make the taker mad;"
Sonnet CXXIX,4,"Mad in pursuit and in possession so;/Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;"
Sonnet CXXIX,5,"A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;/Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream."
Sonnet CXXIX,6,  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well/  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
Sonnet CXXX,0,My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;/Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
Sonnet CXXX,1,"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;/If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head."
Sonnet CXXX,2,"I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,/But no such roses see I in her cheeks;"
Sonnet CXXX,3,And in some perfumes is there more delight/Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
Sonnet CXXX,4,"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know/That music hath a far more pleasing sound;"
Sonnet CXXX,5,"I grant I never saw a goddess go;/My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:"
Sonnet CXXX,6,"  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare/  As any she belied with false compare."
Sonnet CXXXI,0,"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,/As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;"
Sonnet CXXXI,1,For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart/Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Sonnet CXXXI,2,"Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold/Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:"
Sonnet CXXXI,3,"To say they err I dare not be so bold,/Although I swear it to myself alone."
Sonnet CXXXI,4,"And, to be sure that is not false I swear,/A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,"
Sonnet CXXXI,5,"One on another's neck, do witness bear/Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place."
Sonnet CXXXI,6,"  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,/  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds."
Sonnet CXXXII,0,"Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,/Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,"
Sonnet CXXXII,1,"Have put on black and loving mourners be,/Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain."
Sonnet CXXXII,2,"And truly not the morning sun of heaven/Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,"
Sonnet CXXXII,3,"Nor that full star that ushers in the even/Doth half that glory to the sober west,"
Sonnet CXXXII,4,"As those two mourning eyes become thy face:/O, let it then as well beseem thy heart"
Sonnet CXXXII,5,"To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,/And suit thy pity like in every part."
Sonnet CXXXII,6,  Then will I swear beauty herself is black/  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
Sonnet CXXXIII,0,Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan/For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
Sonnet CXXXIII,1,"Is't not enough to torture me alone,/But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?"
Sonnet CXXXIII,2,"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,/And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:"
Sonnet CXXXIII,3,"Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;/A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd."
Sonnet CXXXIII,4,"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,/But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;"
Sonnet CXXXIII,5,"Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;/Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:"
Sonnet CXXXIII,6,"  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,/  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me."
Sonnet CXXXIV,0,"So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,/And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,1,"Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine/Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:"
Sonnet CXXXIV,2,"But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,/For thou art covetous and he is kind;"
Sonnet CXXXIV,3,He learn'd but surety-like to write for me/Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
Sonnet CXXXIV,4,"The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,/Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,"
Sonnet CXXXIV,5,And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;/So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
Sonnet CXXXIV,6,"  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:/  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free."
Sonnet CXXXV,0,"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'/And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;"
Sonnet CXXXV,1,"More than enough am I that vex thee still,/To thy sweet will making addition thus."
Sonnet CXXXV,2,"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,/Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?"
Sonnet CXXXV,3,"Shall will in others seem right gracious,/And in my will no fair acceptance shine?"
Sonnet CXXXV,4,"The sea all water, yet receives rain still/And in abundance addeth to his store;"
Sonnet CXXXV,5,"So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'/One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more."
Sonnet CXXXV,6,"  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;/  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'"
Sonnet CXXXVI,0,"If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,/Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'"
Sonnet CXXXVI,1,"And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;/Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil."
Sonnet CXXXVI,2,"'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,/Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one."
Sonnet CXXXVI,3,In things of great receipt with ease we prove/Among a number one is reckon'd none:
Sonnet CXXXVI,4,"Then in the number let me pass untold,/Though in thy stores' account I one must be;"
Sonnet CXXXVI,5,"For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold/That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:"
Sonnet CXXXVI,6,"  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,/  And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'"
Sonnet CXXXVII,0,"Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,/That they behold, and see not what they see?"
Sonnet CXXXVII,1,"They know what beauty is, see where it lies,/Yet what the best is take the worst to be."
Sonnet CXXXVII,2,"If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks/Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,"
Sonnet CXXXVII,3,"Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,/Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?"
Sonnet CXXXVII,4,Why should my heart think that a several plot/Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
Sonnet CXXXVII,5,"Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,/To put fair truth upon so foul a face?"
Sonnet CXXXVII,6,"  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,/  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd."
Sonnet CXXXVIII,0,"When my love swears that she is made of truth/I do believe her, though I know she lies,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,1,"That she might think me some untutor'd youth,/Unlearned in the world's false subtleties."
Sonnet CXXXVIII,2,"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,/Although she knows my days are past the best,"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,3,Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:/On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
Sonnet CXXXVIII,4,But wherefore says she not she is unjust?/And wherefore say not I that I am old?
Sonnet CXXXVIII,5,"O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,/And age in love loves not to have years told:"
Sonnet CXXXVIII,6,"  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,/  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be."
Sonnet CXXXIX,0,"O, call not me to justify the wrong/That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;"
Sonnet CXXXIX,1,Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;/Use power with power and slay me not by art.
Sonnet CXXXIX,2,"Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,/Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:"
Sonnet CXXXIX,3,What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might/Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
Sonnet CXXXIX,4,"Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows/Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,"
Sonnet CXXXIX,5,"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,/That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:"
Sonnet CXXXIX,6,"  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,/  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain."
Sonnet CXL,0,Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press/My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
Sonnet CXL,1,Lest sorrow lend me words and words express/The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
Sonnet CXL,2,"If I might teach thee wit, better it were,/Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;"
Sonnet CXL,3,"As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,/No news but health from their physicians know;"
Sonnet CXL,4,"For if I should despair, I should grow mad,/And in my madness might speak ill of thee:"
Sonnet CXL,5,"Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,/Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,"
Sonnet CXL,6,"  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,/  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide."
Sonnet CXLI,0,"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,/For they in thee a thousand errors note;"
Sonnet CXLI,1,"But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,/Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;"
Sonnet CXLI,2,"Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,/Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,"
Sonnet CXLI,3,"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited/To any sensual feast with thee alone:"
Sonnet CXLI,4,"But my five wits nor my five senses can/Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,"
Sonnet CXLI,5,"Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,/Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:"
Sonnet CXLI,6,"  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,/  That she that makes me sin awards me pain."
Sonnet CXLII,0,"Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,/Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:"
Sonnet CXLII,1,"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,/And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;"
Sonnet CXLII,2,"Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,/That have profaned their scarlet ornaments"
Sonnet CXLII,3,"And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,/Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents."
Sonnet CXLII,4,"Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those/Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:"
Sonnet CXLII,5,"Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows/Thy pity may deserve to pitied be."
Sonnet CXLII,6,"  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,/  By self-example mayst thou be denied!"
Sonnet CXLIII,0,"Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch/One of her feather'd creatures broke away,"
Sonnet CXLIII,1,"Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch/In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,"
Sonnet CXLIII,2,"Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,/Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent"
Sonnet CXLIII,3,"To follow that which flies before her face,/Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;"
Sonnet CXLIII,4,"So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,/Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;"
Sonnet CXLIII,5,"But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,/And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:"
Sonnet CXLIII,6,"  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'/  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still."
Sonnet CXLIV,0,"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,/Which like two spirits do suggest me still:"
Sonnet CXLIV,1,"The better angel is a man right fair,/The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill."
Sonnet CXLIV,2,"To win me soon to hell, my female evil/Tempteth my better angel from my side,"
Sonnet CXLIV,3,"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,/Wooing his purity with her foul pride."
Sonnet CXLIV,4,"And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend/Suspect I may, but not directly tell;"
Sonnet CXLIV,5,"But being both from me, both to each friend,/I guess one angel in another's hell:"
Sonnet CXLIV,6,"  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,/  Till my bad angel fire my good one out."
Sonnet CXLV,0,Those lips that Love's own hand did make/Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
Sonnet CXLV,1,"To me that languish'd for her sake;/But when she saw my woeful state,"
Sonnet CXLV,2,"Straight in her heart did mercy come,/Chiding that tongue that ever sweet"
Sonnet CXLV,3,"Was used in giving gentle doom,/And taught it thus anew to greet:"
Sonnet CXLV,4,"'I hate' she alter'd with an end,/That follow'd it as gentle day"
Sonnet CXLV,5,"Doth follow night, who like a fiend/From heaven to hell is flown away;"
Sonnet CXLV,6,"  'I hate' from hate away she threw,/  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'"
Sonnet CXLVI,0,"Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,/[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;"
Sonnet CXLVI,1,"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,/Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?"
Sonnet CXLVI,2,"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,/Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?"
Sonnet CXLVI,3,"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,/Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?"
Sonnet CXLVI,4,"Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,/And let that pine to aggravate thy store;"
Sonnet CXLVI,5,"Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;/Within be fed, without be rich no more:"
Sonnet CXLVI,6,"  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,/  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then."
Sonnet CXLVII,0,"My love is as a fever, longing still/For that which longer nurseth the disease,"
Sonnet CXLVII,1,"Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,/The uncertain sickly appetite to please."
Sonnet CXLVII,2,"My reason, the physician to my love,/Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,"
Sonnet CXLVII,3,"Hath left me, and I desperate now approve/Desire is death, which physic did except."
Sonnet CXLVII,4,"Past cure I am, now reason is past care,/And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;"
Sonnet CXLVII,5,"My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,/At random from the truth vainly express'd;"
Sonnet CXLVII,6,"  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,/  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
Sonnet CXLVIII,0,"O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,/Which have no correspondence with true sight!"
Sonnet CXLVIII,1,"Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,/That censures falsely what they see aright?"
Sonnet CXLVIII,2,"If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,/What means the world to say it is not so?"
Sonnet CXLVIII,3,"If it be not, then love doth well denote/Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'"
Sonnet CXLVIII,4,"How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,/That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?"
Sonnet CXLVIII,5,"No marvel then, though I mistake my view;/The sun itself sees not till heaven clears."
Sonnet CXLVIII,6,"  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,/  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."
Sonnet CXLIX,0,"Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,/When I against myself with thee partake?"
Sonnet CXLIX,1,"Do I not think on thee, when I forgot/Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?"
Sonnet CXLIX,2,Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?/On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
Sonnet CXLIX,3,"Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend/Revenge upon myself with present moan?"
Sonnet CXLIX,4,"What merit do I in myself respect,/That is so proud thy service to despise,"
Sonnet CXLIX,5,"When all my best doth worship thy defect,/Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?"
Sonnet CXLIX,6,"  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;/  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind."
Sonnet CL,0,"O, from what power hast thou this powerful might/With insufficiency my heart to sway?"
Sonnet CL,1,"To make me give the lie to my true sight,/And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?"
Sonnet CL,2,"Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,/That in the very refuse of thy deeds"
Sonnet CL,3,"There is such strength and warrantize of skill/That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?"
Sonnet CL,4,Who taught thee how to make me love thee more/The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
Sonnet CL,5,"O, though I love what others do abhor,/With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:"
Sonnet CL,6,"  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,/  More worthy I to be beloved of thee."
Sonnet CLI,0,Love is too young to know what conscience is;/Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Sonnet CLI,1,"Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,/Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:"
Sonnet CLI,2,"For, thou betraying me, I do betray/My nobler part to my gross body's treason;"
Sonnet CLI,3,My soul doth tell my body that he may/Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
Sonnet CLI,4,"But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee/As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,"
Sonnet CLI,5,"He is contented thy poor drudge to be,/To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side."
Sonnet CLI,6,  No want of conscience hold it that I call/  Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
Sonnet CLII,0,"In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,/But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,"
Sonnet CLII,1,"In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,/In vowing new hate after new love bearing."
Sonnet CLII,2,"But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,/When I break twenty? I am perjured most;"
Sonnet CLII,3,"For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee/And all my honest faith in thee is lost,"
Sonnet CLII,4,"For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,/Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,"
Sonnet CLII,5,"And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,/Or made them swear against the thing they see;"
Sonnet CLII,6,"  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,/  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!"
Sonnet CLIII,0,"Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:/A maid of Dian's this advantage found,"
Sonnet CLIII,1,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep/In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
Sonnet CLIII,2,"Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love/A dateless lively heat, still to endure,"
Sonnet CLIII,3,"And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove/Against strange maladies a sovereign cure."
Sonnet CLIII,4,"But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,/The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;"
Sonnet CLIII,5,"I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,/And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,"
Sonnet CLIII,6,  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies/  Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
Sonnet CLIV,0,"The little Love-god lying once asleep/Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
Sonnet CLIV,1,Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep/Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
Sonnet CLIV,2,The fairest votary took up that fire/Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
Sonnet CLIV,3,And so the general of hot desire/Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
Sonnet CLIV,4,"This brand she quenched in a cool well by,/Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,"
Sonnet CLIV,5,"Growing a bath and healthful remedy/For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,"
Sonnet CLIV,6,"  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,/  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love."
